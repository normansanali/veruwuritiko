While she was still in the vehicle,<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Monahan</a></strong> shot and killed her. Here’s why he pulled the trigger, and how much time Monahan will spend behind bars for the crime.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>The day she died, Gillis was traveling with one other SUV and a motorcycle outside Hebron, New York, near Albany. Using a shotgun, Monahan fired twice into the vehicle, hitting Gillis in the neck. With limited cell service in the rural area, the group rushed Gillis to Salem, New York, near the Vermont border, and called 911. By the time emergency services arrived, however, Gillis was dead, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AP</a> reported.</p><h2 id=h-monahan-said-he-didn-t-mean-to-fire-the-second-shot data-injectable=false>Monahan said he didn’t mean to fire the second shot</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>CBS6 Albany/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>After about an hour of negotiating with Monahan inside his home after Kaylin Gillis died, the local police coaxed Monahan to come outside his home and arrested him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for second-degree murder</a>. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monahan, who pleaded not guilty</a>, later testified he fired the first shot as a warning, but the second shot, killing Gillis, was a mistake.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Monahan said on the stand, “I didn’t mean to shoot the second shot. The gun went off” (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AP</a>). At that moment, Monahan added, he thought he and his wife were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“under siege.” When asked what his life is like after Gillis’ murder, he said he felt like his “soul is dead.</a>“</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gillis vehicle made a wrong turn down Monahan’s driveway</h2><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>In the end, Kaylin Gillis died because she and her friends made the mistake of turning down the wrong driveway. Monahan opened fire from his porch as they were trying to leave. In a press conference, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy, who investigated the incident, said: “[Gillis] was an innocent young girl who was out with friends looking for another friend’s house … There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened,” he later added (via the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Times Union of Albany</a>).</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false>When Gillis died, her family said in a statement:</p><p>“Kaylin was a talented artist, an honor student, a Disney fanatic, and loved animals. She was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist.”</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>In January 2024, Monahan was convicted of second-degree murder as well as reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence.
