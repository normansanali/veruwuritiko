She noted that WWE approached her about inducting Neidhart by himself. However, she wanted wanted him to be inducted with Hart.</p><p>“When my dad and Bret were going into the Hall of Fame, it’s funny because I was very, very adamant…at one point, I was basically presented with the idea of my dad going in by himself. I said, ‘I want my dad and Bret in there together as the Hart Foundation.’ Because that was my dad’s favorite time in his career,” Natalya said. “That’s when he had the most fun, that’s when he was the most alive.</p><p>“That’s when he did his best work, and Bret just looked out for him so much, and they were so close and such a well-liked machine. In that moment, Vince was like, ‘We can put your dad in by himself,’ I was like, ‘I want my dad and Bret together. I want them together because my dad would have wanted that.’ So that was really cool to be able to do that for my dad. It was something that, I know he would have been so excited to be a part of the Hall of Fame.”</p><p>The full interview is available here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>x</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqanFqaGK7osDApbCaZaessm67xZ%2Bcq52UYsGwecinm66bpGK3qrmMp5yinJiWv7V5yKerqGWYlrmtec6fZJ%2BZnZp6o8WMoaCmq5Whsw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-wears-mossy-green-alexander-mcqueen-2020.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Wears Alexander McQueen for First 2020 Outing</span></a>
