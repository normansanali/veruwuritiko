So, if that sounds like your cup of tea, read further for some of the best medical shows on Netflix.</p><p class=dh>While some television genres have felt like they have come and gone, medical TV shows have appeared only to have grown. Over the years, we've seen classics like "Grey's Anatomy" and "ER" reimagined, and hospital shows are being produced beyond Hollywood.</p><p class=dh>For years, directors and producers have found ways to keep fans hooked with their series' intense and emotional plots. However, some of the best medical shows have added a personal touch to their hospital sets by telling the fictional stories of doctors and nurses to pull at the heartstrings.</p><p class=dh>While most people come for the drama and the shock factor of medical tragedies and emergencies, it is believed that the popularity of medical shows can be boiled down to an audience's desire to watch stories about people.</p><p class=dh>According to George Ikkos, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine's psychiatry department, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbr.com/medical-dramas-work-audiences/>medical shows</a> like "Casualty" are both dramatic and exciting while also being relatable through character development. So, without further ado, here are seven of the best <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thecinemaholic.com/reality-medical-shows-on-netflix/>medical series</a> on Netflix.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Life'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In light of the rise of South Korea's influence in the entertainment industry, "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8243158/>Life</a>" offers fans of medical shows a great South Korean option. The series is about a university hospital undergoing a difficult transitional period as the medical institution fights to hold onto its integrity while a private corporation takes over.</p><p class=dh>However, a team of doctors at the hospital comes together to challenge the ways of the private company, which is trying to turn the non-profit hospital into a money-making business.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Doctor Cha'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27075857/>Doctor Cha</a>" is another South Korean production recently released with an addictive storyline. Directed by Kim Dae-jin and Kim Jung-wook, Doctor Cha is an older woman who gave up her medical career to start a family.</p><p class=dh>However, after learning of her husband's cheating, the female lead makes a few drastic changes, including returning to practicing medicine. After overcoming a few challenges in the workplace, Doctor Cha ends up building her career.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'New Amsterdam'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In this <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7817340/>series</a>, actor <a class="me a" href=#>Ryan Eggold</a> plays Dr. Max Goodwin, a medical professional who takes on the role of the Medical Director of one of the United States' oldest public hospitals, the New Amsterdam Hospital.</p><p class=dh>However, Dr. Goodwin is not only tasked with turning around the once pioneering hospital; viewers watch as he also has to work to get the rest of the hospital staff on board while walking a thin line between mixing business with pleasure.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Medical Police'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9850952/>Medical Police</a>," co-starring Erinn Hayes and Rob Huebel, is a spinoff to the parody drama "Childrens Hospital" and adds a humorous edge to a sometimes intense television series genre.</p><p class=dh>The show follows two doctors, Lola Spratt and Owen Maestro, working to find a cure for a deadly virus. However, the two doctors are unaware that their hard work will lead to unearthing deep, dark secrets.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'The Night Shift'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2477230/>The Night Shift</a>" is centered around the diverse staff working the late night shift in the often chaotic San Antonio Memorial Hospital emergency room. And, like "Grey's Anatomy," the show adds a personal touch by focusing on the characters' personal lives.</p><p class=dh>While you might come for the drama and thrill, you'll stay because you care, whether it be about the rebellious former army medic or another doctor trying to move up in the ranks, whoever becomes your favorite.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Grey's Anatomy'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/>Grey's Anatomy</a>" has graced the small screen for years and has earned its title as a medical series classic. Narrated by Dr. Meredith Grey (<a class="me a" href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a>), the series follows the lives of the Seattle Grace Hospital doctors, residents, and staff.</p><p class=dh>However, <a class="me a" href=#>Shonda Rhimes's</a> hit show does not only include dangerous surgeries to leave you on the edge of your seat or dramatic storylines and medical mysteries. "Grey's Anatomy" also captures the complexities of everyday life, such as balancing your career and your love life, grief, navigating friendships, and more.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>'Hospital Playlist'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>This third South Korean show wraps up this list of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://movieweb.com/medical-tv-dramas-on-netflix/>best medical shows </a>and tells the story of five doctors in their forties who are very different from each other but have been friends since medical school.</p><p class=dh>For the first time in their careers, they all work at the same hospital, which inevitably brings them closer. The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11769304/>show</a> received high praise for the few seasons it aired and had a little something for everyone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1oa2lpbHp4ecyem6KbkaF6tLTOsKpmp55iu6bAxaWgsWWkna61ecCrnGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oingo-boingo.html><span>←</span><span> Oingo Boingo Stay lyrics</span></a>
