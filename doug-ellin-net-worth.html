In 1993, he debuted by writing and directing the short film “The Pitch”. The same year, he directed another film entitled “The Waiter” with stars David Schwimmer, Jon Cryer and Joe Alaskey. In 1996, he wrote and directed another comedy – “Phat Beach” – including stars Jermaine “Huggy” Hopkins and Coolio.

In 2002, Ellin was part of the team of scriptwriters of the sitcom “Life with Bonnie”. In 2004, he created his own series, “Entourage”, broadcast on HBO; produced by Mark Wahlberg. the series tells the daily life of Vincent Chase, a young promising actor in Hollywood. The series is noted for its impressive array of guest stars and its filming, rarely done in the studio.</p><p>What a startling fact: Ellin failed in stand-up comedy, yet proved to be a master at creating comedy drama and sitcom series and films, and even made a fortune out of it. Recently he has written the script for the upcoming Christmas black comedy crime film “Bad Santa 2”, directed by Mark Waters, scheduled for release at the end of 2016. Undoubtedly, all the aforementioned works have significantly increased the total size of Doug Ellin net worth and popularity, and his success has been widely recognized. He has been nominated for four Writers Guild of America Awards, three PGA Awards and three Emmy Awards. As previously mentioned he won only the PGA and BAFTA.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the screenwriter, producer and director, he married Melissa Dana Hecht in 1996, and they have a child, but divorced in 2009.
