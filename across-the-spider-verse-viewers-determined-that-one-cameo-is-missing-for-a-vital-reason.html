They claimed that there is a reason why out of all the characters that appeared in the movie, Stan Lee wasn’t included. And no it has nothing to do with the comic book writers’ death. After all, Stan Lee has appeared in other Marvel movies without a facial appearance at all.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>According to the TikTok user, the reason why Lee wasn’t in it is because of Miguel O’Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099. In the film, Miguel wanted to ensure that all the Spider-Man stories are the same. That they all have to suffer the same way through the death of a loved one and that “canon events” shouldn’t be messed with. Miguel’s beliefs on what makes one a Spider-Man is different from Lee’s, which was anyone could be Spider-Man.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@ href=#>@</a> <a title="♬ - " href=#>♬ –</a></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>This belief could be further emphasized thanks to an old interview Lee did in 1977 with CBS. During his appearance on&nbsp;CBC’s 90 Minutes Live, the comic book writer revealed that he made Spider-Man relatable because many readers resonated with him. He was someone that’s like the everyday reader.</p><p>“You know Woody Allen, and you know he’s for real. Well, I’ve always thought if Woody Allen were a superhero, he’d be Spider-Man. Or if I were a superhero, cuz nothing ever turns out right for me…<br>“… they didn’t serve dinner till 5 minutes before the fella called and said ‘you gotta be here in 5 minutes!’ So I just had time to take one mouthful of something and race over here so I could wait for an hour backstage. This is what would happen to Spider-Man.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>While Lee wasn’t featured in this highly-anticipated Spidey-sequel, he did appear in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>&nbsp;as a shop clerk in a costume/collectible store. He spoke to Miles Morales, encouraging him to still wear the Spider-Man costume he bought, even if it doesn’t fit because “it always fits… eventually.”</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&nbsp;is now showing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Ccqairo2LBqbGMrKeinJWnerex0aycZq6ZmsSmvtJmm56slae6qrrEnWStoJGperC6xGaamqWVpHqqv4ymoKyrmaO0brLOq2SaZaaewaK4jKucmqufo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-arianna-davis-lizzos-former-dancer.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Arianna Davis, Lizzos former dancer?</span></a>
