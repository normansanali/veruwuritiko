It has been reported that the foursome all received a fee for the episodes, while the celebrity contestants who took part donated their earnings to charity. A spokesperson for Channel 4 has now issued a statement. "Our aim is to raise as much as possible for Stand Up To Cancer," it read. "Those contracted for long-running series make a significant donation to the campaign. As a result of their involvement millions have been raised with 100 per cent of the money raised going to fund ground-breaking research."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/712bf880b438-bake-off-stand-up-to-cancer-2018-teri-hatcher-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eCGHvtpoNcnZ data-wc=17><strong>Channel 4 has responded to claims the team were paid for the recent charity specials</strong></p><p id=eDnPLPMCxp4R data-wc=57>A source added that the show involved "a big time commitment for filming several episodes and doing voiceovers later", and "it was up to them to decide what to donate".

Judge Prue said that the American star "hardly put a foot wrong" throughout the challenges, while Paul added: "She had the whole package, she was Star Baker by quite a margin." Teri, who has won several Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Golden Globe, said: "Winning this Star Baker apron is definitely up there with every award I've ever won."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
