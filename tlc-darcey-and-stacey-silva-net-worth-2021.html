Considering how well the duo has done for themselves, viewers wanna know just how much they're worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Darcey And Stacey: Watch A Sneak Peek Of Stacey’s Wedding Dress, ‘She...Looks Like Miss Piggy’</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-are-darcey-amp-stacey-silva-worth>How Much Are Darcey & Stacey Silva Worth?</h2><p>Darcey and Stacey Silva first came about back in 2010 when they landed their very own reality series, The Twin Life. Although they filmed a single season, the show never made it on-air, however, that wouldn't be the last we see of them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Darcey and Stacey snagged a spot on the hit TLC series, 90 Day Fiance, appearing in the Before The 90 Days series. Fans were immediately drawn to the twin sisters, mainly when it came to their upbeat personalities, Barbie looks, and outrageous romances.</p><p>Well, after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">failing to find love on </a>90 Day Fiance, Darcey and Stacey scored their own series in 2020, Darcey & Stacey, which has just returned for its second season, yes, second! Considering fans cannot get enough of their on-screen antics, it's no surprise that TLC renewed their series for a second go.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: 10 Important Things We Learned In The Premiere Of Darcey & Stacey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans know them mainly from reality television, Darcey and Stacey have a few businesses outside of appearing on TLC. With success in much of what they do, the duo is estimated to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth a combined $6 million!</a></p><p>The duo has certainly found themselves working the cameras when it comes to reality TV, not holding anything back, however, they're far more than just TLC stars! Darcey and Stacey Silva are also the founders of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their very own clothing brand</a>.</p><p>The twins founded their label, House of Eleven, back in October 2010, which sparked interest in producers to film a reality show centered around their business. While the series never saw the light of day, their clothing brand has done wonders!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The label specialized in everyday clothing all while focusing on swimwear, sportswear, and leisurewear since that's quite literally right up Darcey and Stacey's alley.</p><p>Their brand to this day has amassed over 40,000 followers on Instagram and has been worn by a number of A-list celebs including Demi Lovato, Jessica Alba, and Jeannie Mai, to name a few.</p><p>Darcey and Stacey launched the brand as a tribute to their late brother, Michael, who passed back in 1998. The duo is also in charge of Eleventh Entertainment, their own production company.</p><p>This has allowed the duo to executive-produce comedies such as White T in 2013 as part of their work for the company. Although they've had success, it appears as if the two are no longer tied to the production company, and focus mainly on their brand and of course, their show!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Were Darcey And Stacey Silva Before 90 Day Fiancé?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirpZtdma6zr8SyZJqmlGLAta3CnrBmq5mhw6J5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZFpaWpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabby-morrison-net-worth-253280.html><span>←</span><span>Gabby Morrison Net Worth</span></a>
