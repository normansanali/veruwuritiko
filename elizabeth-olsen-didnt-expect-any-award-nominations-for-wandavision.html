But it came as much more of a shock to series lead Elizabeth Olsen — who herself got an Outstanding Lead nomination, as did co-star Paul Bettany, for her work as Wanda Maximoff in the miniseries.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Appearing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</a> this week to hype up her return in Doctor Strange 2, Olsen reflected on all the Emmy buzz surrounding WV and explained that the highlight of the ceremony for her was just the chance to come together with the show’s cast and crew. As she put it:</p><p>“I mean, it was very surprising. No one does a Marvel job and thinks that you’re going to get nominated for something. But, we did! And we actually got to celebrate together for the first time at the Emmys. Because we wrapped during COVID. I wish that everyone was together. Like, department heads and everything. But, it was special to be there and celebrate our show among really serious things.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEmDw0X0AgF5ZH.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEmDw9XwAgoEt2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEnGFOXIAovKH6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEnGFSXoAITn-T.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEnUtkXoAcse30.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQEnUtMXEAcwslT.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>While Olsen’s right that Marvel actors don’t do what they do to snag awards, she’s obviously being pretty humble here as her portrayal of the grief-stricken witch, who goes from perfect sitcom wife to all-powerful sorceress across the nine episodes, definitely deserved the kudos it brought her. Though Wanda’s always had her fans, it was her own vehicle that turned her into a major MCU favorite, which is why her comeback in the Doctor Strange sequel is one of the <a href=#>most anticipated things about it</a>.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>Catch Olsen in action — in what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">critics are calling</a> another terrific performance — in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness this weekend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymuMizmJudpJ16sLjSnqVmnJmZu7V5xLGnnpukYq6vxYyarpqqlGK7sLnIp5itoZ%2BjwG6yzqtksJmema63tdKipqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./como-vincular-instagram-con-facebook.html><span>←</span><span>Cmo vincular Instagram con Facebook</span></a>
