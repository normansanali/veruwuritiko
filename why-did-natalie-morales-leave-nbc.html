But what made the <a href=#>Today Show alum</a> bolt from her longtime gig?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why did Natalie Morales leave NBC?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>For years, Natalie was a familiar face on the <a href=#>Today</a> show, and also appeared frequently on Access on NBC. But in 2021, the <a href=#>star said goodbye to NBC</a> and jumped ship over to CBS, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>It turns out that Natalie had been, well, thinking about making the leap to The Talk for years before the move actually happened.</p><p>"I knew The Talk could really showcase my personality, but also that I knew I would have great chemistry with the other co-hosts, which I had at the Today show, of course, but living here in Los Angeles — this is the big game in town," she explained at the time.</p><p>Of course she would be referring to <a href=#>Sheryl Underwood</a>, <a href=#>Amanda Kloots</a>, <a href=#>Jerry O'Connell</a>, and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, who co-host The Talk, which was created by <a href=#>Sara Gilbert</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Natalie Morales (@nataliemoralestv)</a></p></figure><p>"I had been on this show as a guest before, and every time I came, I just really loved the experience of being here. I loved the audience interaction and how involved they are with the hosts. It's funny because from the minute I walked out here, it was like I felt like I'm at home," Natalie further elaborated.</p><p>The newswoman added she hoped to also work in some capacity with the CBS News team.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Natalie Morales soon became a CBS News anchor.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Natalie Morales (@nataliemoralestv)</a></p></figure><p>A year after Natalie joined the gang at The Talk, it seems her efforts to carve out a bigger role for herself at CBS News paid off. She took on a role behind the news desk and has been working steadily ever since.</p><p>At the time, Neeraj Khemlani, president and co-head of CBS News and Stations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a>, "Natalie is one of the best in the business and a welcome addition to CBS News. She has excelled at the highest levels — from network morning shows to longform storytelling — and we couldn't be more thrilled to have her on our team. She will be doing stories for 48 Hours, CBS Mornings, CBS Sunday Morning, and others. She knows how to get to the heart of a tough story with compassion and grace."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Natalie Morales (@nataliemoralestv)</a></p></figure><p>Today, Natalie balances parenthood and a busy schedule as a working mom — not that it's easy.
