While Kohei Matsuno (aka Mattsun) of Tokyo’s official job title is that of a barista, in all actuality he is a latte artist. His caffeinated and creative journey began in 2009, when he decided to add a little intrigue to his job at an Italian restaurant by drawing a design in the foamed milk of a latte."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

His caffeinated and creative journey began in 2009, when he decided to add a little intrigue to his job at an Italian restaurant by drawing a design in the foamed milk of a latte.</p><p>Over the course of just a few short years, Mattsun has completed over 500 works of latte art. He was showcased in the 2012 ‘Blue Sky Latte Art’ exhibit in Dotonbori, Osaka, and has become quite the internet sensation thanks to our coffee-obsessed culture.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17700 alt="The Scream" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LatteArtTheScream.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-17700 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>NPR</a></p><p>Mattsun has covered a wide range of subjects in his work, including animals, popular anime characters, celebrities, and famous two-dimensional art pieces. As Mattsun has grown in popularity, his customers have demanded more from him as an artist. The solution? Adding three-dimensional pieces to his artistic expertise.</p><p>The 3D creations require much more foam than a typical latte. Because of time constraints concerning the life of the foam (as well as serving customers), Mattsun needs to conceptualize and visualize his anticipated creation before beginning the whole process. With a simple spoon and a sharp toothpick, he sculpts and prods the unusual medium in what he describes as “a race against time”. Mattsun has only a five-minute window before the foam begins to deteriorate, and thus needs to make good use of every second.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Kohei Matsuno's Latte Art" width=800 height=513 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LatteArtTwoCups.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Mattsun now spends his time bringing to life the many ideas requested to him by his dedicated fan base. He has a very active <a href=#>Twitter account</a>, where he posts the images of all his new coffee creations. Next on his list of dreams to accomplish is being able to start a mobile café in order to travel and share his unique art with people across Japan.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Latte Art In Progress" width=800 height=519 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LatteArtInProgress.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt=Anime width=800 height=1070 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LatteArtAni.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt=Fireworks width=800 height=1067 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/LatteArtFireworks.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonytrdOtnGaZoqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teyana-taylor-and-her-daughter-are-launching-a-new-clothing-line-called-jujubeez.html><span>←</span><span>Teyana Taylor And Her Daughter Are Launching A New Clothing Line Called JuJuBeez.</span></a>
