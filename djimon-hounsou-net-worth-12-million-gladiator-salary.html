At the end of the day, Hounsou's biggest role by far was when he appeared in one of the biggest movies of all time, Gladiator.

He has also starred in several music videos, including "Sweetest Taboo" by Sade and "Love and Happiness" by Maxwell.</p><p>Hounsou's net worth is largely derived from his acting career. He has also earned money from modeling and from his endorsement deals. He is a highly successful actor with a long list of credits to his name.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-djimon-hounsou-make-from-starring-in-gladiator>How Much Money Did Djimon Hounsou Make From Starring In Gladiator?</h2><p>According to Screen Rant, it is estimated that Hounsou made between $500,000 and $1 million for the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gladiator was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $500 million worldwide. This made it the highest-grossing film of 2000. Hounsou's performance in the film was also critically acclaimed, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6F166FB2-D007-477B-865B-241048DA14EE.jpeg><p>Hounsou's performance in Gladiator was critically acclaimed, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

During the filming of the fight scenes in the Colosseum, Hounsou accidentally came close to stabbing someone in the head with his sword. He later recalled the incident during an interview with Variety, saying "I almost accidentally stabbed somebody in the head in the fight sequence in the Colosseum when Maximus gets on the horse. Most of us got carried away, and I think I was one of the few who didn't get hurt".</p><p>Hounsou had never fought with a sword before being cast in Gladiator. He had to train for months to learn how to use a sword and to perform the fight scenes in the film. He later said that learning how to fight with a sword was one of the most challenging things he has ever done.</p><p>In addition to all of that craziness, <a href=#>Russell Crowe almost fought a real tiger</a> during a fight scene gone wrong, which really showed how committed the cast of the film was.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Russell Crowe Lost Over 40 Pounds Ahead Of Gladiator</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the awards and money, Hounsou walked away from the movie with a close friendship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hounsou and Crowe became close friends during the filming of Gladiator</a>.
