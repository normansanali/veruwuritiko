Although Drew has opened up about her marriage struggles (and we'll see some of this unfold in this season of RHOA), she and Ralph are motivated to stay together and have as healthy of a relationship as possible for her kids.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>‚ÄúI find myself having, just to put on a strong face for [my kids],‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo act like this is normal and really deep down inside, I was going through it emotionally," Drew said, per Us Weekly. She added, "I mean, my husband, as you will meet Ralph Pittman, he is, you know, a character. He just says whatever he feels. And this marriage counselor, he really respects. And I think she‚Äôs really been helping both of us to see each other‚Äôs perspective. We are actively in counseling now.‚Äù</p><p>Aside from working on their marriage, the couple is also working on ... their family sleep schedule. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Drew opened up</a> to Us Weekly about "relaunching" their sleep system.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>‚Äú[It‚Äôs] a space that we‚Äôre in to come together in partnership, but it‚Äôs a sleep system to help kids get rest at night," she explained. "This sleep system that [Ralph] developed, it has like a yoga exercise, and it makes the bedtime routine fun, helps them reach REM sleep, which is super important. It also helps kids that suffer from insomnia and even mental health. We have come together during this whole time through marriage counseling to relaunch it and I‚Äôm excited. We‚Äôre excited about that.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ralph has been very open about how seriously he takes his role as a father. On Instagram, he shared a photo of himself and his step-son Josiah, writing, "Christmas was the first time my son JoJo met his biological dad and it was a special moment for our family. Anyone that knows me understands that I advocate for fathers. To no ones fault, I was raised in a single parent household and experienced the void of a fatherly figure."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>Christmas was the first time my son JoJo met his biological dad and it was a special moment for our family. Anyone that knows me understands that I advocate for fathers. To no ones fault, I was raised in a single parent household and experienced the void of a fatherly figure. I missed out on valuable lessons, experiences and most importantly, character development. It‚Äôs funny, but I use to watch my friends with the side eye to learn things I wasn‚Äôt exposed to! I always told myself that if I can play a role to fill the void of another child, I would and now I‚Äôm doing it! Shoutout to all the step dads that step up to be real dads and to uncles, cousins and friends that fill voids. It‚Äôs a challenging role, but understand your purpose and impact is greater than any acknowledgement you may or may not receive. To fathers that may not be as present due to whatever circumstance, understand it takes a village to raise a king/queen and please play your part. To all fathers all over the world, I salute you!! Make one of your goals in 2020 to be a better dad üíØ. üì∑@reubenchandlerphotography #dad #dadsmatter #dadgang</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Ralph Pittman</a> (@ralphpittmanjr) on Dec 31, 2019 at 1:37pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Shoutout to all the step dads that step up to be real dads and to uncles, cousins and friends that fill voids.
