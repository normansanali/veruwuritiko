The latest complete system test suite is PCMark 10, upgrading over PCMark 8 with updated tests and more OpenCL invested into use cases such as video streaming.</p><p>PCMark splits its scores into about 14 different areas, including application startup, web, spreadsheets, photo editing, rendering, video conferencing, and physics. We post all of these numbers in our benchmark database, <a href=#>Bench</a>, however the key metric for the review is the overall score.</p><p align=center><img alt="PCMark10 Extended Score" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102705.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There's a slight issue using PCMark with having IGP drivers installed then restarting the system using a discrete GPU installed. We'll come back and rerun when the time permits.</p><h3>Chromium Compile: Windows VC++ Compile of Chrome 56</h3><p>A large number of AnandTech readers are software engineers, looking at how the hardware they use performs. While compiling a Linux kernel is ‘standard’ for the reviewers who often compile, our test is a little more varied – we are using the windows instructions to compile Chrome, specifically a Chrome 56 build from March 2017, as that was when we built the test. Google quite handily gives instructions on how to compile with Windows, along with a 400k file download for the repo.</p><p>In our test, using Google’s instructions, we use the MSVC compiler and ninja developer tools to manage the compile. As you may expect, the benchmark is variably threaded, with a mix of DRAM requirements that benefit from faster caches. Data procured in our test is the time taken for the compile, which we convert into compiles per day.</p><p align=center><img alt="Compile Chromium (Rate)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102706.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>3DMark Physics: In-Game Physics Compute</h3><p>Alongside PCMark is 3DMark, Futuremark’s (UL’s) gaming test suite. Each gaming tests consists of one or two GPU heavy scenes, along with a physics test that is indicative of when the test was written and the platform it is aimed at. The main overriding tests, in order of complexity, are Ice Storm, Cloud Gate, Sky Diver, Fire Strike, and Time Spy.</p><p>Some of the subtests offer variants, such as Ice Storm Unlimited, which is aimed at mobile platforms with an off-screen rendering, or Fire Strike Ultra which is aimed at high-end 4K systems with lots of the added features turned on. Time Spy also currently has an AVX-512 mode (which we may be using in the future).</p><p>For our tests, we report in <a href=#>Bench</a> the results from every physics test, but for the sake of the review we keep it to the most demanding of each scene: Ice Storm Unlimited, Cloud Gate, Sky Diver, Fire Strike Ultra, and Time Spy.</p><p align=center><img alt="3DMark Physics - Cloud Gate" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102707.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="3DMark Physics - Sky Diver" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102708.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="3DMark Physics - Fire Strike Ultra" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102709.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="3DMark Physics - Time Spy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102710.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>GeekBench4: Synthetics</h3><p>A common tool for cross-platform testing between mobile, PC, and Mac, GeekBench 4 is an ultimate exercise in synthetic testing across a range of algorithms looking for peak throughput. Tests include encryption, compression, fast Fourier transform, memory operations, n-body physics, matrix operations, histogram manipulation, and HTML parsing.</p><p>I’m including this test due to popular demand, although the results do come across as overly synthetic, and a lot of users often put a lot of weight behind the test due to the fact that it is compiled across different platforms (although with different compilers).</p><p>We record the main subtest scores (Crypto, Integer, Floating Point, Memory) in our benchmark database, but for the review we post the overall single and multi-threaded results.</p><p align=center><img alt="Geekbench 4 - ST Overall" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102711.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img alt="Geekbench 4 - MT Overall" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph13526/102712.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50gZFvZqKmpJq5bsTEqKVmnV2nsre1xLBknmphbYOoecCnm2aln6eybsDErKuenF9r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlise-castro.html><span>←</span><span>Charlise Castro - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Career</span></a>
