However, as funding for Almo Sounds began to decline, Heap was dropped from the label. In the following period while without a label she performed multiple songs for the film G:MT – Greenwich Mean Time, released two singles, and was featured on guitarist Jeff Beck’s 2001 album You Had It Coming. In early 2002, Heap and Sigsworth formed the electronic duo Frou Frou, and released their only album to date, Details (2002). The duo broke up in late 2003, though they did reform temporarily to record a cover of the Bonnie Tyler song “Holding Out for a Hero” as part of the Shrek 2 soundtrack.</p><h2>Imogen Heap Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Imogen Heap is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Imogen Heap</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was classically trained in piano, cello, and clarinet as a child; however, she ended up teaching herself how to play drums and guitar.</p><p align=justify>She received the British Academy’s <a href=#>Ivor Novello</a> Award for International Achievement in 2010.</p><p align=justify>Imogen Jennifer Heap (/ˈ ɪ m ə dʒ ɪ n ˈ h iː p / ; born 9 December 1977) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer and audio engineer. Born in the London Borough of Havering, Heap became classically trained in piano, cello and clarinet at a young age. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and, while attending boarding school, taught herself both guitar and drums, as well as music production on Atari computers. Heap signed to independent record label Almo Sounds at the age of 18 and later began working with experimental pop band Acacia, alongside Guy Sigsworth, as a frequent guest vocalist.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In August 2002, they released the Details album and singles “Breathe In”, “It’s Good To Be in Love”, and “Must Be Dreaming” (although the latter two were not commercially available). The album was critically acclaimed, but did not enjoy the commercial success that they had been hoping for until 2004 when the song Let Go became a hit from the Garden State soundtrack.</p><p>Heap’s early success was soon replaced by problems. Almo Sounds cut funding for UK promotion and gave Heap a deadline to deliver songs for her second album. Upon delivery of the songs, she was told that they lacked “hit potential”. It was announced that the record label would be sold to Universal and its artists moved to other labels or released. Heap was one of the artists who was dropped from the label, leaving her without a record contract. iMegaphone had, however, been licensed from Almo Sounds to Aozora Records in Japan, who eventually re-released and re-promoted the album in January 2002, featuring “Blanket” and “Aeroplane” (a Frou Frou remix/remake of one of her B-sides, “Airplane” of the Shine single released in 1998). The album featured new packaging, all-new artwork, and a previously unavailable hidden track, entitled “Kidding”, recorded live during her 1999 tour.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Imogen Heap height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Imogen <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Heap’s debut album, iMegaphone (an anagram of “Imogen Heap”) was a mixture of self-penned and self-produced tracks, alongside tracks co-written and produced with established producers such as David Kahne, former Eurythmic Dave Stewart, and Guy Sigsworth. The album was released in 1998 internationally via Almo Sounds, to favourable reviews comparing Heap’s angst-filled songs to work by PJ Harvey, Kate Bush, Chrissie Hynde, Siouxsie Sioux, and Annie Lennox. Promotion for the record included a tour of America and performances around Europe. Three singles were commercially released in the UK: “Getting Scared”, “Shine” and “Come Here Boy”. “Oh Me, Oh My” was sent to US radio stations in place of “Shine”.</p><p align=justify>Heap and Sigsworth remain firm friends, and have worked together since the project, including their temporary re-formation in late 2003, when they covered the Bonnie Tyler classic, “Holding Out for a Hero”, which was featured during the credits of the movie Shrek 2 after Jennifer Saunders’ version in the film.
