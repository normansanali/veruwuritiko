With the new NIL rules in place since July 2021, college athletes have been able to earn millions of dollars from endorsements, appearances, and autograph signings, among other activities.</p><p>One of the most popular <a href=#>college sports</a> in the United States is football, and it is no surprise that football players have received the most NIL compensation since the new rules were implemented. According to On3.com, the NIL marketplace is currently worth between $750 million and $1 billion, and college athletes earned an estimated $917 million through NIL in the first year. Football and men's basketball players received the most compensation, with football players earning an average of $2,000 to $3,000 per deal.</p><p>Among the highest-paid college <a href=#>athletes</a> are Alabama quarterback Bryce Young, who is estimated to have earned $800,000 in NIL compensation in his first year at Alabama [2]. Young has endorsement deals with companies like Cash App and H&R Block. Another high earner is Jackson State quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who is estimated to be worth $1.6 million [3]. Sanders has endorsement deals with Subway and BMW.</p><p>However, football is not the only college sport where <a href=#>athletes</a> are benefiting from the new NIL rules. College gymnasts have also been able to monetize their talent and brand, with LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne topping the list of the most valuable NIL athletes, worth an estimated fortune of over $9 million. Dunne has endorsement deals with Gatorade and BMW.</p><p>Auburn gymnast Sunisa Lee is another college athlete who has been able to earn significant NIL compensation. Lee, who won the gold medal in the women's all-around gymnastics competition at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, has endorsement deals with Nike and Chipotle. Similarly, Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, who was the top-ranked high school football recruit in the country before reclassifying and enrolling early at Ohio State in 2021, has endorsement deals with Holy Kombucha and GT Sports Marketing.</p><p>Women's basketball players have also been able to earn significant NIL compensation. South Carolina women's basketball player Zia Cooke is estimated to have earned $600,000 in NIL compensation in her first year. Cooke has endorsement deals with Pizza Hut and Dick's Sporting Goods. UConn guard Paige Bueckers, who was the 2021 AP Women's Basketball Player of the Year, has endorsement deals with Nike and Gatorade.</p><p>Other college sports where <a href=#>athletes</a> have been able to monetize their NIL include baseball, golf, and volleyball. Vanderbilt pitcher Kumar Rocker, who was a first-round pick in the 2021 MLB Draft, has endorsement deals with Adidas and Panini America. Golfer Rachel Heck, who plays for Stanford, has endorsement deals with Ping and Callaway. Volleyball player Lexi Sun, who plays for Nebraska, has endorsement deals with Adidas and Vertical.</p><p>Despite the restrictions in place, such as not being able to use a school's logo or trademark to profit, and not being allowed to be classified as employees or gain compensation based on athletic performance, college athletes are already benefiting from the new NIL rules. The NCAA is working to explore ways to ensure that athletes can profit while maintaining a level playing field.</p><p>In conclusion, football players have received the most NIL compensation since the new rules were implemented, but athletes from other college sports, such as gymnastics, basketball, baseball, golf, and volleyball, have also been able to monetize their talent and brand. With the NIL marketplace expected to grow to a $3 billion to $5 billion industry within the next five years, college athletes will continue to have new opportunities to earn money while still being able to compete at the collegiate level.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXai9sL7TZp6erKNiwamxjKamrKxdo7atecyopZ6x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ubah-hassan-age-how-old-is-she-rhony-cast-family-and-career-details-676646-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ubah Hassan Age: How Old Is She?
