The horse, meanwhile, continued to trot down the road until police safely stopped it.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240321 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stereo-system-in-amish-buggy.jpg alt="Stereo System In Amish Buggy" width=600 height=659 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-240321 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Trumbull County Sheriff’s Office</span><span class=caption-body>In the buggy were open bottles of alcohol in addition to a full 12-pack of Michelob Ultra. Nobody has yet come forward to claim their belongings, including the horse and buggy.</span></p><p>After authorities inspected the buggy and found several open bottles of alcohol beside the sound system, the vehicle was towed. Police also made sure to find someone who could safeguard the horse until the owner identified himself. As of yet, nobody has come forward.</p><p>While the Amish community as a whole doesn’t forbid its members from drinking alcohol, many of their sects do. It’s unclear which sect these riders were a part of, though their reactionary escape might indicate as much. Then again, drinking and driving is just as illegal horseback as it is in a car.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The New York Post</a>, the Amish faith was by Anabaptist Swiss-Germans in the 1500s. They’ve since become known for their minimalistic lifestyle in the countryside foregoing modern amenities like stereo systems, for instance.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240333 alt="Amish Family Riding Buggy" width=800 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/amish-family-riding-buggy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240333 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>While the Amish are encouraged to test out the traditional life experiences of modern society during a period known as “Rumspringa,” alcohol is otherwise forbidden across many Amish groups. Drinking and driving, of course, is also federally illegal — even aboard a horse and buggy.</span></p><p>This wouldn’t have been the first time the Amish were slapped with a DUI. Many members have received DUIs for driving their buggies drunk, such as a 21-year-old Ohioan who ran a stop sign in April and subsequently admitted he drank 10 beers beforehand.</p><p>In 2012, four Amish people were arrested for drinking while underage and crashing their buggy into other buggies, then fleeing the scene. The dichotomy of a strict, no-tolerance policy and exploring the experiences of adolescence, seems to have prevented some of these young Amish from accepting the societal repercussions of their actions.</p><p>At least Chief Deputy Joe Dragovich seems to think so, as he said the two men could be charged with both failure to comply with the deputy’s commands and driving under the influence.</p><p>“Maybe there’s just that fear of the consequences — and that would be a reality check for them, that there are consequences,” he said.</p><p>As it stands, the horse has been handed off to a local farmer. The two Amish men who ran off are still in the wind, while Chief Deputy Dragovich urges them to face the music and retrieve their buggy.</p><p>Next up, take a look at these 69 <a href=#>photos from Woodstock</a>.
