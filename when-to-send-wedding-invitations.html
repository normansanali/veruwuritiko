They should be sent out between six and 12 months before your wedding and this will depend on when you have that information ready. Once you have your venue and date confirmed I would suggest sending your save the date towards the top end of that to ensure it is firmly in people’s diaries. Remember, if your celebrations are taking place over a number of days to include these all.</p><p id=epMEgLROYplv data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to choose the perfect wedding stationery</a></strong></p><h2>Do we need a wedding website?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/70ebab2e6af3-wedding-website-z.jpg><p id=e6OC0sQuCGC6 data-wc=103>Many people wonder whether they should have a wedding website and there are so many different options out there. My advice to couples is to consider a website only if you have enough helpful information to include on it. There is a tendency to include lots of photos and information on the couple which I would argue is not necessary. If you are <a class=hm-link href=#>having a destination wedding</a>, or a wedding taking place over a few details, when you need to help guests with accommodation, travel, and other logistics then a website can be very helpful. Otherwise I would suggest avoiding one and saving yourself the trouble.</p><p id=eOOmAyoNAF6- data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why DIY wedding decor isn't the best way to save money – expert</a></strong></p><h2>When to send your main wedding invitations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d6f77ccb4bb-woman-opening-wedding-invitation-z.jpg><p id=eaW0uEMyq4TD data-wc=49>When you need to send this will depend on the amount of information you need to share with your guests. I usually suggest three to four months in advance unless you are having a destination wedding when you may want to do this sooner or consider the website approach.</p><p id=eKq2z9bMZyDO data-wc=49>The most important thing to do is to think through all the information your guests will need to know from their point of view and align your invitations to that. Aside from being a beautiful first look at your wedding, your invitations are devices to keep your guests informed!</p><h2>Keep your guests in the know</h2><p id=eHIinULLr232 data-wc=89>What you need to tell your guests will depend entirely on your wedding plans. The basics include dress code, dietaries, and timings but this may also need to include accommodation, parking, and venue access. I would always go down the too much approach as opposed to too little. Guests can always ignore information if they don’t need it but if they don’t have it in the first place they will always land up asking you! Helpful information can be included on a card or letter to accompany the invitation.</p><p id=eBgZFVHqBuEK data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Who should sit on the top table at your wedding? Dos and Don'ts</a></strong></p><p id=ej9c2_KKAgUz data-wc=48>Another approach which we use a lot is to have a digital letter which includes everything a guest may need to know and to respond with this when they confirm attendance. "RSVP for more information," is also a clever way of ensuring your guests respond in good time!</p><p id=eekXf8lWiiIo data-wc=23><strong>Planning your wedding?
