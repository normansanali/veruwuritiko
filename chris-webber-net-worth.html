This huge success had brought much wanted attention for Chris, and in no time, he received numerous offers from colleges throughout the entire USA, however, he had chosen to stay close to his family, and selected the University of Michigan.</p><p>In University he continued in the same fashion, dominating in every aspect of the basketball; he was awarded numerous accolades, including the All-American first team, however, as he was involved in the University of Michigan basketball scandal, those awards have been vacated.</p><p>Nevertheless, Webber`s professional career began in 1993, when he was selected by the Orlando Magic, as the first overall pick in the 1993 NBA Draft.
