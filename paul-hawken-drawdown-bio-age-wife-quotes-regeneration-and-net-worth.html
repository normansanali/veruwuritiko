So what are we waiting for?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-hawken-blessed-unrest></span><span>Paul Hawken Blessed Unrest</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming is a 2007 New York Times bestseller by Paul Hawken.&nbsp;The book is about the many non-profit groups and community organizations, dedicated to many different causes, which Hawken calls the “environmental and social justice movement”. Hawken explains that this is a diverse movement with no charismatic leader.</p><p>The movement follows no unifying ideology and is not recognized by politicians, the public and the media. But, Hawken argues, it has the potential to benefit the planet.&nbsp;A New York Times reviewer states that Blessed Unrest is “about a movement that no one has noticed, not even the people involved”. Hawken also tells the stories of other people who have endured hardship and difficulty as they stood up to large corporations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-hawken-regeneration></span><span>Paul Hawken Regeneration</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paul wrote about Regeneration as a response to the urgency of the crisis, a determined what-to-do manual for all levels of society, from individuals to national governments. He captioned, “We and all living beings thrive by being actors in the planet’s regeneration, a civilizational goal that should commence and never cease. We practiced degeneration as a species and it brought us to the threshold of an unimaginable crisis. To reverse global warming, we need to reverse global degeneration.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-hawken-quotes></span><span>Paul Hawken Quotes</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The following are some quotes by Hawken;</p><ul><li>Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them.</li><li>All is connected… no one thing can change by itself.</li><li>The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces, or at least not try to defy them.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-hawken-books></span><span>Paul Hawken Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>1993 – The Ecology of Commerce</li><li>1999 – Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution</li><li>2006 – Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming</li><li>1987 – Growing a Business</li><li>1975 – The Magic Of Findhorn</li><li>1983 – The Next Economy</li><li>1982 – Seven tomorrows: Toward a voluntary history</li><li>2014 – Sustainable World Sourcebook: Critical Issues, Inspiring Solutions, Resources for Action</li><li>2021 – Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation</li></ul><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-paul-hawken></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions about Paul Hawken</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-paul-hawken></span><span>Who is Paul Hawken?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paul Hawken is an American Environmentalist, Entrepreneur, Author and Activist.
