Recouping its budget 20 times over at the box office, A24’s unstoppable juggernaut came close to clearing $90 million in ticket sales, buoyed by an impressive 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes score.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Talk-to-me-mia.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Not only that, but the Philippous revealed just weeks after its release that they’d already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shot a Talk to Me prequel</a>, with a direct sequel confirmed shortly after.
