But aside from <a href=#>her crazy antics and risqué performances</a>, Madonna also earned a reputation for being a bad neighbor at one point. It was actually a whole legal drama... Here's what really happened back there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madonna Turned Down The Role Of This Iconic DC Comics Character</a></span></p><h2 id=madonna-s-neighbor-filed-a-noise-complaint-against-her>Madonna's Neighbor Filed A Noise Complaint Against Her</h2><p>In July 2012, Madonna's neighbor filed a noise complaint against her following a loud after-party at her Mayfair home. George Michael and Stella McCartney were among the singer's guests. "It went on until quarter past two. It was all out in the garden – it woke me up," said the neighbor who revealed that the Westminster Council didn't do anything about it until late. "She is a pain," added the complainant who refused to be named.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The council spokesman said in a statement that authorities were eventually sent to Madonna's home. They confirmed that a resident from Great Cumberland Place called in the noise at midnight. "When officers arrived, they could clearly hear music and shouting," said the spokesperson. "In their opinion, it was unreasonable on a weekday evening so they served a noise abatement notice on the owner of the house. As soon as the notice was received, the volume was turned down and there were no further complaints."</p><p>In 2009, Madonna's New York neighbor, Karen George also made noise complaints against her. George filed legal papers citing "unbearable noise and vibrations" in the pop star's seventh-floor apartment which overlooks Central Park. She added that the singer's dance routines caused "blaring music, stomping and shaking walls" for three to four hours a day. George also sued the management company of the Manhattan building for failing to act on her complaints. However, Madonna claimed that the noise levels never exceeded legal limits. She also stopped using her apartment for rehearsals after the complaint since she'd already built a studio elsewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Madonna Really Date Lenny Kravitz?</a></span></p><h2 id=where-does-madonna-live-now>Where Does Madonna Live Now?</h2><p>Madonna moves from one house to another depending on her tours. In 2017, the singer made headlines after moving into a $7 million palace in Lisbon, Portugal. According to Hello magazine, the "18th-century Moorish Revival mansion is 16,146-square-foot and includes four bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a guesthouse and a caretaker's cottage." The Rain hitmaker moved there to support the football career of her son, David Banda. In 2019, Madonna revealed that she was moving out of the mansion because she felt "alone". âââ</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I moved to Lisbon to be a soccer mom. I wanted to be a soccer mom. I thought it would be adventurous. But I found myself alone, without friends, a little bit bored," said the Evita star. "I was invited to a fado club. The music is made up of melancholy, sadness and longing — the best description of me." At one point, Portuguese media said that "Madonna is no longer a tourist, she now lives in Lisbon." These days, the singer splits her time between London, Beverly Hills, and New York City.</p><p>Madonna owns a six-story Georgian Townhouse in London's poshest area, Marylebone. It has ten bedrooms and is reportedly her sixth property in the city. The $8 million brick home also has a built-in studio and an adjacent staff's bungalow. The singer bought it when she was still married to Guy Ritchie. She ended up selling their 1.17-acre Sunset Boulevard home after their split. She initially bought it for $12 million from actress Sela Ward and sold it for $19.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madonna Pays This Much To Keep Her Hands Wrinkle-Free</a></span></p><p>As for her Manhattan apartment, she first bought a townhouse on East 81 Street and eventually acquired two neighboring houses to make one big home for her and her children. The 13-bedroom house is now valued at $40 million. It features a king-size library and a 3000 sq. ft. garden. Neighbors say that you'd never know Madonna lived there except for the occasional black SUVs that pick her up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, Madonna labeled her return to NYC as a "new life" and a "reinvention." At the time, she reportedly started working on her biopic with screenwriter, Diablo Cody. "The pair turned in a finished, final draft of the script they spent months working on throughout 2020," wrote Entertainment Weekly back then. There were rumors that the two had a falling out which caused Cody to leave the project.</p><p>But it was later clarified that the Juno writer had simply finished her part in the script. "A studio source at Universal, where the film is gestating, tells EW that reports of the Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter's 'departure' from the movie have been exaggerated, and that Cody simply completed her work and moved on to her next project," the publication added.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Madonna And Piers Morgan’s Ongoing Feud</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoba3tc2gZKedqKl6tbuMppidp56jrm7DwKxkmmWenrSpwMyaqZ5llqS%2FbrTEq2SnnZmctaO70axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thomas-middleditch.html><span>←</span><span>Thomas Middleditch Height, Weight, Family, Facts, Education, Biography</span></a>
