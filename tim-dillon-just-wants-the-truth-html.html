What’s good without evil?” The wealthy are of particular interest to Dillon, inasmuch as he believes that their success stories are often manufactured, misrepresented, or generally overlooked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkmjs8459jdo3ch@published data-word-count=93>November 1-3, Dillon will be taking part in the <a href=#>New York Comedy Festival</a> by giving a tour of “The Real New York,” which is to say: he will be hilariously yelling at a busload of comedy-going tourists about their own shortcomings in comparison with the accomplishments of New York’s social elite (and so much more!). After the tour for November 1st rapidly sold out, producers quickly added a November 2nd date, which quickly followed suit.

I’d love to have somebody who used to work for a government agency or something on, but right now we’re trying to get a high-end realtor in New York. One of the top real estate agents, because that, to me, is fascinating. I want to know what it’s like to be at the top of that business in a city like New York, or what that takes. Those people aren’t coming on my show. We’ve had some real cool people come on, but a lot of people, especially people in those areas that are very conscious of their brand, are a little reluctant to come on, which I get. If they are going to do something like that, it’s going to be like Barbara Walters or something.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkqjs84w3cgleuv@published data-word-count=4><b>Are you brand-conscious yourself?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkrjs84o78gy1im@published data-word-count=70>The thing is, my brand is loose, because to me it’s whatever is interesting and funny. I think I have a definitive voice in the way that I look at the world, cynical and whatever.

It’s not at all different from anything else. Comedians like to think that they are different from a bunch of guys that are just filing into an office somewhere in Midtown Manhattan. They’re not. It’s just humanity. People want to be comfortable, they want to be liked, they want to be important. I think that causes people to, in many cases, just try to embrace this community aspect.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkujs84aeog5ndt@published data-word-count=115>To that end, you see a lot of people not taking risks, not being funny. I think funny comes from the willingness to be unpopular, or to fail… to make the joke that is <i>not </i>what everyone is thinking. I don’t necessarily always try to do that. I don’t know if I’m a contrarian. I don’t think politically I line up with anything. I think it’s all fake. I think the election, I think it’s all pretend. I’m one of those; I believe in power structures and all that stuff. I would much rather talk about what’s generally called “conspiracies,” because I find them to be closer to the actual truth of what’s going on.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkvjs84tl8v3wsp@published data-word-count=38>In comedy, I look at social media and I see everybody has lined up on one side of an issue, and I always try to see if there’s a funny way to look at it from another way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkwjs844nfu66ba@published data-word-count=13><b>So you’re more focused on bridging a gap than taking a contrary stance.</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkxjs84y1rlkan1@published data-word-count=128>Yeah. When everybody is like, “We hate Donald Trump,” I’m like, “Okay, we all hate Donald Trump, but Trump’s funnier than most of you.” That’s the fact. You know what I mean? That’s a reality. He’s probably also a horrible person, he’s also <i>funnier </i>than most of you. I’ve seen you, I’ve gone to these shows in Bushwick, I did them for years, I watched so many of these people get up, they are not funny. It’s weird to me that out in the community of people, so many of them are failing and not doing their job, but they get on social media and they’re like… It’s as if I walked around Goldman Sachs, and started giving them advice, because I had read a lot about finance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkyjs842do4rkwe@published data-word-count=60>Be funny. It’s just trying to look from a different angle. You look at some of the comedy, the people on the highest level are John Oliver and Jon Stewart, and it’s amazing. Then you see people try to emulate that and fail, and I’m like, “Oh, well let me look at it another way and see if that’s …”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h80xkzjs84hvc475f1@published data-word-count=144>Then I beat up on stuff for fun. I make fun of improv a lot. A lot of my act improvised, and it’s not as tight as… There are improv guys that are amazing. Chris Gethard is a good friend of mine, he’s an amazing talent. I think it’s funny to talk about improv and bully these improv kids, or the Bushwick crowd. A lot of my friends are in that scene when I go do those shows. I think it’s just funny to pile on, in good humor. I did all those all of those shows frequently before… I’m in year seven of comedy, and before I did any clubs, I <i>just</i> did those bar shows, and if I didn’t have those bar shows, what would I have done? Even though I make fun of stuff, I think it’s funny. I’m not angry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl0js84n7hushch@published data-word-count=14><b>What do you think one of the biggest problems is right now for comedy?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl1js84mjxqnpwn@published data-word-count=60>It’s hard to make a living. If you look at the financials of it, it’s just hard. It’s just like, I’m going to die. It’s tough, you’re getting paid the same as comics got paid 20 years ago to do spots and stuff, financially it’s tough to do. People have to work a day job for a long, long time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl2js849c3dxxjl@published data-word-count=11><b>Were you doing the bus tours before you started doing comedy?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl3js84cjc51q3k@published data-word-count=130>No, no. That was one of the day jobs I had to make ends meet. I’ve only been making a living in comedy for like nine months. The majority of the time, I had a full-time day job. That’s one of the things, when I look at it, I go, there are very few jobs where you <i>have</i> to have another job for so long. Yeah, that’s the other thing. At a certain point, I think people have to decide what role comedy is going to play in their life and what they are giving up to do it. My dad was a musician for a while, then he had me and it was like, “Well, now I’ve got to make a living. I have to make a better living.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl4js840ioialfv@published data-word-count=22><b>You tried that work-a-day lifestyle before you did comedy though too, right?

I was okay, but I’m not a good salesperson. That’s part of my fascination with these things that I wasn’t good at. I couldn’t shut up. I would try to sell somebody something and my boss would just go, “Dude, shut up.” I do it in general meetings where the manager’s like, “Just stop talking.” I’ll be like, “Well, you don’t like that idea.” They’re like, “We do like that idea.” I’m like, “No, no, no, but listen.” I just keep going.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl6js844ga4lkp9@published data-word-count=106>I think it’s a word-economy issue. It’s why I’m better at Facebook than Twitter. It’s why I’m better at comedy than sales, because I have more time to talk. I was never happy working. I was also in the closet, I hadn’t come out of the closet until I was 25. That’s pretty late by today’s standards. I was drinking and using drugs, and I stopped that five and a half years ago. I got into comedy, I came out of the closet, and I stopped using drugs and drinking in the same three-month span in the fall of 2010. It was a weird life change.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xl7js84y9v6vl6e@published data-word-count=34><b>I love that.

I think that I’m just trying to get funnier and better at things that I’m not that good at.

Those people had all kinds of different views on America, on this city, on everything. It allowed me to be with them. Some tour guides are great tour guides, but they don’t want to be funny. I always want to be funny. Some people want to do a one-man show, I guess this tour bus thing I’m doing is kind of my one-man show, but it still seeks to be funny.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xlfjs84tq082w33@published data-word-count=88>So I would spend a lot of time with those people trying to be funny. I think that helps, and that was good, because I was in a situation where I had to think on my feet, I had to improv. Some people were angry. It’s a hellish job, it’s too hot, it’s too cold, the bus isn’t on time, these people miss whatever stop, they’re supposed to get off at Empire and they miss it.

I would just try to do something different than a lot of the other tour guides were doing. I wasn’t just like, “Oh, there’s the Chrysler Building,” I would be like, “Rich people have islands of sex slaves and chase them around!” Many people would be like, “Oh, that doesn’t sound fun, you’re lying.” Then people would be like, “Oh, I thought this was for kids.” I’d be like, “Will you shut up?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xljjs84zk5wr05z@published data-word-count=150>Some people would really enjoy it. There’d be some people that were like, “Oh, this is nuts.

What a great honor. Isn’t it good to be worked to <i>death</i>?” I have so many friends that are DJs and personal trainers, who spend their lives washing their car; wouldn’t it be great if I heard one of them was worked to death? “Ryan? He was worked to death, he was working so hard he jumped out of a window!” Go to his parents and say, “Good job.

One of my episodes of my podcast was dedicated to Illuminati satanic pedophile cults. I find those fascinating. It’s very hard when you’re coming at the world from that angle, to sit at a table with a bunch of people that are like, “What about Hillary’s emails?” and I’m like, “Sit down. Sit down.” If 10 people are talking about something, to me, not only is it not interesting, but it probably doesn’t matter. You know what I mean? I really do believe, without sounding too crazy, that we are very easily manipulated on an emotional level in this country and world. One thing I talk about on my podcast is my study of the the rich, and I have done an <i>extensive</i> study. I funded my own study, it’s all self-educated, but these people are able to really control their emotions. On a fascinating level, they are able to make decisions from a more pragmatic point of view. I feel like sometimes everyone and people like me are just marionettes just jumping around, like “Emails!” and “He said this! She said that!” Then it’s like, “But you don’t look at the bigger picture.” It’s like: well, wait a minute, what <i>aren’t</i> we all talking about? What’s behind all that that we aren’t discussing? The United States military is involved in so many of these countries, we’re only talking about one or two of them.

It’s a systemic problem, it’s the way the levers work. It’s wrong. To fully understand it, and I don’t even fully understand it, you have to research and read, and then you realize it’s a systemic problem. Then what is hard is people realize, “Oh, if it’s a systemic problem, I play a role in it. I play a part.” I used to drive around Long Island just getting high for years.

If I look back at my childhood, and I go, “I could have went to jail, I could have been a felon, I could have never had a job.” People don’t want to live in that world.

It’s easy to be like, “Trump sucks! I don’t like Hillary, she’s corrupt!” Oh stop it. Everyone’s corrupt on some level. I used to go into 16 Handles and I would try each of the yogurts, and never buy a yogurt and leave. Then they would stop me and they’d be like, “Stop doing that.” I’d go, “You shut up!” I said, “Don’t be a company man. You work at 16 Handles, don’t let them make you lose your dignity right now. Don’t let them. Look at me, I’m a person. You’re in this larger organization telling me this yogurt matters; it doesn’t matter.

I love crowd work, I love riffing, I love the intersection of when I have a bit and I can ask you something and build off your response and turn it into something. I love talking through stuff. My comedy is not like the tightest thing in the world. There are punchlines, there are jokes, but it’s like, I like the space to be loose. Especially in a long set. You’re headlining somewhere or something like that, the idea that I can be like, “There’s this bit I have, let me try to build on it.” So yeah, I think part of it is, you’re doing well and you’re measuring yourself against the other comics on the show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xm5js84buty62vv@published data-word-count=23><b>It is okay, in your mind, to measure yourself against other comics?</b> <b>I feel like a lot of comics disagree on that point.</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xm6js84e2vtmuwz@published data-word-count=95>Yeah, I think it’s fine.

Because a lot of it is like, you shouldn’t measure yourself against comics in terms of your value or your worth, but at any given moment, if you’re evaluating a certain <i>set</i>, or a certain <i>reaction </i>that they got out of an audience that you didn’t, I think that’s fair.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xm7js848mwdjhmw@published data-word-count=8><b>Your bus tour has sold out twice already.</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xm8js84mzfmk3n5@published data-word-count=5>And they’re adding a third.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xm9js84tksz7ua6@published data-word-count=12><b>Wow.

It has nothing to do with standup. “This is why you’re a pig” is the subtitle. People say, “I’m not a pig. I went to a state school and I married someone I love, and we do 5Ks and I’ve got two kids.” Oink, oink, you’re a pig. Why are rich people rich? They’re not like you. F. Scott Fitzgerald has a great line in <a href=#><i>The Rich Boy</i></a>, I think, where he says, “Let me tell you something that the rich do differently from you and from me: they are cynical where we are trusting, and they are soft where we are hard.” I’ve always loved that. These are real human beings. I’ve always been fascinated by these people, I think because they won’t have me. This is a different set of folks. It’s always fascinated me. How do you get there? That’s a whole different world. Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue, it’s fascinating. You start thinking about the schools they go to, the social clubs they’re a part of, and you realize it’s a small world. Their world is <i>designed</i> to stay small.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xmdjs8448hvarrt@published data-word-count=52>That was always fascinating to me, it’s like these people that stay rich. There are these crazy people who believe the world is run by lizards, I don’t believe that.

Even if I made lots and lots of money in entertainment, there are certain codes, beliefs, ethics that are common to that community, and they’re shifting, they’re always changing. I had a guy, <a href=#>Russ Baker</a>, on my podcast, he goes, “That community, they’ll sue each other and they’ll fight, but the minute an existential or external threat comes along, they will unite to vanquish it.’” That’s fascinating to me. It’s a system preserving itself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xmfjs84edicpdro@published data-word-count=44><b>Earlier you were talking about how the fact that the rich are so cold and aloof is part and parcel of why they’re successful; do you try to emulate that?

I don’t know if it would harm my comedy. I think I can retain my work ethic. I don’t know. It’s an interesting question. If you found that all-encompassing love… When you really fall in love with someone, you start making stupid decisions. That’s why rich people guard themselves against it. If you fall in love with someone, and you’re in love with them, and you make a bad decision, in order to keep that bad decision going, you have to make a smaller bad decision, and then you’re married and legally in an arrangement with someone who may not share any of the values of that world that you’re in, but you’re with them because you fell in love with them, and that feeling kind of fades. That feeling of love will fade, I think. That in itself is interesting. It really speaks to the idea that you need a <i>partner</i> more than a husband or wife.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xmhjs84rjwa33uh@published data-word-count=174>It’s the idea that they’re like us. That they are just like us, and they’re on the couch and one of them farts and the other is like “Did you fart!?” That’s not it at all. There is this weird, comforting thing that like, because if everyone is like you, then you’re just a couple good decisions away from it. The thing is, a sociopath doesn’t sell. You can’t go to Hollywood, and when somebody asks you, “Why are you here.” You go, “Well, I stepped on everyone’s neck. I had friends that looked like they were doing well, I distanced myself from all of them, I didn’t have a relationship for 10 years, in fact, I didn’t even feel anything, I was a hollowed out person. Even now, Barbara, I still don’t really feel much. I look at you, and you could explode in front of me…It would do nothing to me. I don’t feel the way that you do.

They don’t care! They are living in a 20,000 square-foot home in Malibu; they don’t care. The real story, which is always more interesting to me, that’s the real story of how you got there. Your ability to just never take “no,” to just keep going. That doesn’t come from a healthy place, I really don’t believe it does. For some people it might, but for the majority of people, you made these little sacrifices, you do these things, you compartmentalize these emotions, you get tough, and I think that’s the interesting story. That’s the story I want to hear. I don’t want to hear, “Well, mother always said I was going to be great.” It’s like, “No, but tell us what really got you here.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5s9h90xmjjs84h2m6rufq@published data-word-count=201>I would love a real interview with some of these Wall Street people where some of these women go, “You’re so stylish, why are you so stylish?” and they’re like “I wanted, as a little girl, to really do something different. I wanted to help people. I was bullied as a little girl. Then I went through puberty, and I got pretty, and I realized that I was at a cross in the road, and I realized I could go and still be that girl that helped people, but I wanted to make everyone pay and suffer for what they did to me.” You know what I mean? That’s the interview I’d like to see. Because then you go, “I want to see the real monsters.” I don’t want to see some nonsense about like, “Well, I just love fashion.” All these people, what does this come from? What does it mean? Because I’ll be honest about my shit. I spent time in crack houses and I got into drugs; I started doing blow at 13 and was a closet homosexual; my mom is schizophrenic. That’s why I’m like this.
