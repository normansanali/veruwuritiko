After portraying special agent Simone Clark for a year, the actress learned that The Rookie: Feds had not been renewed for a second season.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLqgQBmcLxv data-wc=46>ABC's decision to cancel the show was finally announced in November 2023, after an arduous six-month wait. Following the season one finale, the show was initially put on hold in May, but with the subsequent SAG-AFTRA strikes, the network was forced to postpone all decision-making abilities.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a18e65b2f3e6-niecy-nash.jpg><p id=enX8QEYPzV2 data-wc=50>Prior to the announcement, Niecy had revealed her hopes for a series renewal in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Variety</a>.

"I'm happy for little Black and brown girls to see something that they can aspire to be. Less than 1% of Black women make up the FBI. She's a Black woman over 40 in the FBI. She's not married. She's an equal-opportunity dater, if you know what I mean.
