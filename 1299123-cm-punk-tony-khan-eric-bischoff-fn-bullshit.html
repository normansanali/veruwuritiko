Khan answered first, calling Bischoff’s remarks “bullsh-t” before going into great detail about why it simply wasn’t true and how it was supported by evidence.</p><p>“That’s f-ckin’ bullsh-t. There’s only one person that can attest to that. I don’t know what other people — I can only attest what’s happened here and public record and some of these things are a matter of public record because things like Freedom Of Information [Act] and stuff. So we do have over the years a good amount of financial data in pro wrestling. I can tell you, no one wrestler has ever come in and make a bigger plus delta financial difference in the history of my company, this is the third-year anniversary this week, going k to year four, no one person has ever made a more positive impact. We just did a record pay-per-view buy. Every pay-per-view, he’s done a four pay-per-view cycle now, every one of them was the record. Whether it was All Out, where he was a huge part of the draw with Darby and his debut of course was a huge thing from The First Dance, the biggest Rampage draw in the history of that show.</p><p>“The matches, he carried the Friday Night War, which by the way is a mattering of record in the f-cking court in the state of California that we won the Friday Night War. Just ask [WWE attorney] Jerry McDevitt because he f-cking wrote it. This guy win it versus Matt Sydal, who’s a great wrestler, he had another goddamned great match on Friday. This f-ckin’ guy, he f-ckin’ did the Friday Night War, he did The First Dance, he’s done the record Double or Nothing, he did the record All Out in his debut. He was a big part of a record Full Gear, great match with Eddie Kingston. He’s wrestled a bunch of young guys and veterans in between there. Will Hobbs, Daniel Garcia, goddamn it. And then he showed up, did the biggest program in terms of everything, TV, box office, ever with MJF. And then he did the goddamn main event here. He’s the biggest part of financial success in the history of this company. Let’s f-ckin’ go.”</p><p>Punk took a more diplomatic approach and said that he never got into a “Twitter war” with Bischoff, who he didn’t refer to directly by name.</p><p>“Yeah, good answer. I will quasi-answer that. I didn’t have a Twitter war with anybody. I never mentioned him by name. And I think people <a href=#>like that just need to die in the dark</a>. I don’t need to speak their name and stuff like that. I’m focused on what we’re doing and the positives we bring to the world.”</p><p>&nbsp;“I don’t want anybody to die. [laughs] But nevertheless it’s bullsh-t.”</p><p>&nbsp;“Everybody’s got a sh-t opinion. So let him have it.”</p><p>&nbsp;“That’s a sh-tty opinion. It’s the most bullsh-t opinion I’ve ever heard, and like I said, I hope the answer I gave backs up why he’s the opposite. He’s actually for us the biggest financial success story.”</p><p>Punk <a href=#>previously addressed Bischoff’s original comments</a> by saying that fans should “stop amplifying all the old head bad faith bad take carny dipshits” and that they should be left to die in the dark with their ego podcasts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFycGpqY2KwrnnPrqWkZaSku7p5yqGYp2WVp7akecGiqpygn5uzbrLNZpmupJyotarA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-true-meaning-behind-pure-souls-by-kanye-west.html><span>←</span><span>The True Meaning Behind Pure Souls By Kanye West</span></a>
