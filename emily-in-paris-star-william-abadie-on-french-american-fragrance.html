And that for American women it might be more of an occasional wear.”</p><p>Abadie even says a French man would give his mistress a different scent than his wife. “I would imagine for the mistress’ fragrance to be more ‘coquine’ as Sylvie would call it — richer, a more seductive scent perhaps with notes of amber.” For the wife, though, a “fresher, sweeter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">warmer scent</a>” would be more appropriate. “Perhaps with notes of peonies and vanilla.”</p><p>Emily, as an American in Paris, would obviously pick up on the necessity of fragrance, wearing different scents for different occasions, opines the actor. For an important work meeting, he thinks Emily would favor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy Love by Marc Jacobs</a>. But when it comes to date night, he says she’d probably opt for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentino’s Donna Born In Roma Eau de Parfum</a>.</p><p>So what does Abadie prefer in his real, day-to-day life as a French actor? “I personally enjoy something more spicy and or woody,” he says, noting that he wears <a href=#>Krigler Monsieur Dada 18</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5q6qrjYZqCnZaCWv6q%2FjKyrmqpdrLatuMiapGaZkpaxqrGMqKVmnqKau6S0jJqknqqZmK6vecWrmKCqkaOwpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./243755-ziggy-marley-is-a-doting-father-7-childr-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ziggy Marley Is a Doting Father of 7 Children Glimpse into Bob Marley's Son's Fatherhood</span></a>
