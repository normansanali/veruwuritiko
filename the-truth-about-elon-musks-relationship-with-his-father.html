He bought Errol Musk and his family a house, cars, and a boat. But Elon realized their relationship was beyond repair once he understood Errol was never going to change as a person, per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>However, Errol maintained a different version of the events, and in an interview with <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>, he said he moved back to South Africa after only two years because his wife, who was Afrikaans, wanted to be near her family. Errol believed that Elon interpreted his return to South Africa as a personal affront, and this contributed to their broken relationship.</p><p dir=ltr>Errol also said Elon is resentful about his feelings toward the United States. Errol refuses to settle in America and doesn't share his son's feelings about the country. He says Elon's anger towards him stems from their differing views about America, as Elon planned to make a home in the U.S. for his father. Errol and his wife struggled to return to South Africa since Elon had taken their passports, and they communicated clandestinely with the South African embassy in order to get back home. (Elon refutes the idea that he held his father hostage.) However, Errol said Elon's feelings eventually thawed, and even flew to South Africa once to throw him a birthday party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlG1wcG9fqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZpylp55iura%2Fyqxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXay2tbSMoaCsZZaWwamx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-clock-is-ticking-for-john-wick-chapter-4-as-mysterious-countdown-emerges.html><span>←</span><span>The clock is ticking for John Wick: Chapter 4 as mysterious countdown emerges</span></a>
