Firstly, to hax, you don't need to parattractflinchfusion, there are simpler methods. To paralyse, there are <i>so</i> many options avaialble. Thunder Wave is a TM with vast distribution, spanning five generations, having Pokemon of all types able to learn it. Then you have Glare and Stun Spore too, which have bad and relatively good distribution respectively. Of course, it's not like there are other methods to spread paralysis, right?<p>Even if we ignore the ones with a not-so-great chance of paralysing (mind you, there is a ton of these, several even being TMs), you are left with Discharge, Body Slam and Secret Power, each having a 30% chance to cause paralysis (or 60% with Serene Grace). Discharge is in pretty much every Electric types' arsenal and has a bit of non-Electric type distribution too. Body Slam was a TM in the first two generations and a truckton of things could learn in, but now that it's a Move Tutor move in the third and fourth gen, so much more can get it. Secret Power also happens to have a huge distribution in the third gen as a TM. And, that's just the <i>basics</i> of paralysis spreading.</p><p>Now, let's take that plethora of Pokemon able to paralyse, and realise that that's at least 60 or 70% of all Pokemon. Considering the huge distribution of Swagger (TM), Confuse Ray, Signal Beam (Move Tutor), Headbutt (Move Tutor and TM), Waterfall (HM), Attract (TM), and <i>so</i> much more hax-oriented moves, I'm sure at least 85-90% of Pokemon can hax. That's just about as much that can spam Double Team, isn't it?</p><p>2) So do the Pokemon with Double Team. Taunt, Torment, Imprison, Roar, Whirlwind, Psych Up, Swift, Magical Leaf, Aura Sphere, etc. Or, you could not let the opponent waste 6 turns setting up in your face.</p><p>3) It takes no skill to get lucky, or not get unlucky, does it? Even if your opponent resists Togekiss' Air Slash, they still have a 50% chance of getting through confusion, 50% through attract, 75% through paralysis, and a 40% chance of getting through flinching. I'm no mathlete, but I can tell you that's a very slim chance, and even if you do get through, what can you do in just one turn to a bulky Togekiss - provided you live that long of course.</p><p>#lawyered</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy0uc6gpqdlkaOxbrvToZyrq12Xrq%2B6yKeeZqeWYr2wt8Smpqdlp528bq3RnmStoJWuerW7jJ2cnKGUmntyf5BybWlnoJa0pnmQbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-waisglass.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Waisglass Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
