She also enjoys spending time with family and friends and cheering on her favorite football team, the Seattle Seahawks, per her Instagram page.</p><p>At this time, there’s no telling how long Amber has worked as a flight attendant. But, since Amber has traveled to multiple countries, it’s safe to say she has been in the industry for quite some time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Amber has been married not once, but two times before 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><p>Unfortunately, Amber has received the short end of the stick when it comes to relationships. In the series, Amber revealed that she has been single for three years after dealing with two failed marriages.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"A lot of people are pretty shocked. They're like, 'Oh, you've been married twice?'... I was just so not appreciated, and I don't ever want to get to that point again, you know?” Amber said on the series. “I don't want to have to burn myself out loving somebody just getting scraps in return. I don't want a repeat of that. So I put time and effort into thinking about what I want for the future and I'm so ready."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At this time, Amber has been relatively quiet about the identities of her ex-husbands.

After living the single life for three years, she wants to “find my person that sees me for me.” She’s seeking an “intelligent and confident” guy with a nice smile who can be her “travel buddy” during her layovers for work. Amber won’t put up with anyone who is “messy and selfish.” But, if she does find her Mr. Right, get ready, because she says, “When I care about you, I care BIG."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Initially, Amber made a connection with Paul Peden. The pair not only bonded emotionally and mentally, but also through Amber’s love of beignets also landed well with Paul who hails from New Orleans.</p><p>However, it appears that Amber and Paul’s connection wasn’t strong enough to build a lasting match. Paul ultimately decided to move on to another contestant, leaving Amber distraught.</p><p>So, Amber is presumably single and back on the hunt for her special someone.</p><p>The first five episodes of Love Is Blind Season 4 are now available for streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqjsdFmrqKklJq%2FbrjOr5xmoaNir621zZ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-camille-winbush-biographynet-worth-more.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Camille Winbush: Biography,Net Worth &amp;amp; more</span></a>
