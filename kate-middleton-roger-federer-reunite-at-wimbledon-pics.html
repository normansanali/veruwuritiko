The duo were joined by local ball boys and girls last month to show off their skills on the court <a href=#>following the athlete’s retirement from the game.</a></p><p>“The unsung heroes of @wimbledon,” a post on Kate and Federer’s individual Instagram accounts read alongside a video of them on the field in June. “The skill and dedication of the Ball Boys and Girls help make The Championships so special. They certainly taught us a few things!”</p><p>Kate, who shares kids Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, with husband <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>, went on to say that she was impressed by the young talent training for Wimbledon’s big event.</p><p>“To see the training and the dedication and the amount of time that is put into the training and making sure this goes well on the day for the champions who are playing at Wimbledon … Yeah it’s incredible to see it behind the scenes,” the royal shared in a clip, which was released via YouTube at the time.</p><p>During her game with Federer, Kate <a href=#>surprised the tennis icon</a> when she caught the ball with one hand. “Are you allowed to do that?” he asked a ball girl before the duchess chimed in, “Oh wait, are you allowed to do that? That’s a good question.”</p><p>Federer noted that in Australia players “would catch” the ball but it is not regulation at Wimbledon.</p><p>“Yeah, you’re not meant to catch it,” the ball girl named Mollie explained to the duo. “You’re meant to let it bounce and then catch it, but good catch.”</p><p>Kate has previously opened up <a href=#>about being a fan of the sport — and of Federer</a> — before becoming a patron of the organization in May 2016. (The mom of three, who took over for the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, also serves as the patron for the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the <a href=#>Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union</a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Roger is my mother’s heartthrob,” Kate shared in the 2017 BBC One documentary Sue Barker: Our Wimbledon. “I don’t think she will mind me saying that. I think he probably knows that too. I was really taken by <strong>[Andre] Agassi </strong>and<strong> [Pete] Sampras, [Goran] Ivanisevic </strong>and<strong> Steffi Graf</strong>. That for me was my first memories. … [Wimbledon] inspires young people, including myself. Every time Wimbledon is on I am thinking, ‘Yes, I could do the same’ and get out the racket. Sadly, not the same results.”</p><p>Scroll down for more photos from Kate’s outing:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKLAxGakopyUobK1u81mqaiflad6p7HDnqmeql2nsra6yK2cZpmkYsSqucGlnJ2nnmK9qq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blog.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Carters Net Worth How Much is Jimmy Carter Worth?</span></a>
