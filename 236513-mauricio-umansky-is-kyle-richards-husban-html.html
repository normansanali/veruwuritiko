The news came as a shock to many...</strong></h3><p class=fh>Since it was founded in 2011, the company has expanded exponentially and has been involved in some of the biggest real estate deals.</p><p class=fh>Umansky currently holds the record for selling the most homes above the $20 million mark. He has represented some of the world's biggest properties, including Walt Disney estate, the Playboy mansion, and properties owned by Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson.</p><p class=fh>Despite his hugely successful career, Umansky remains fiercely committed to his wife and family. Even though he prefers to stay out of the spotlight, he has still made a handful of appearances on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>HOW THEY MET</strong></p><p class=fh>Richards and Umansky <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/articles/184363-how-13-of-the-biggest-real-housewives-couples-first-met>first met in 1994</a>. However, there is still some mystery surrounding the location and where it happened.</p><p class=fh>When the lovebirds met, Richards was engaged to Michael Tuck, a news anchor for San Diego's CBS affiliate. The pair never tied the knot because Richards had fallen in love with Umansky.</p><p class=fh>The lovebirds did not waste any time in making things official between themselves. Barely two years after meeting for the first time, Richards and Umansky exchanged marriage vows in 1996.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>KYLE RICHARDS' CHILDREN</strong></p><p class=fh>At the time of their wedding, Richards was already four months pregnant with their first child together, daughter Alexia, 24. They later welcomed two more daughters, Sophia, 20, and Portia, 12.</p><p class=fh>In 2018, Alexia <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/02/kyle-richards-kids-family-husband/>graduated from Emerson College</a>. She is currently working in her dad's company, The Agency. As for Sophia, she is attending college in Washington, DC, and loves to keep a low profile.</p><p class=fh>Richards' youngest daughter Portia graduated from elementary school back in June amidst the on-going coronavirus pandemic. Despite the health crisis, the whole family still turned up for Portia's <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/956996/rhobh-kyle-richards-breaks-down-portia-graduates/>drive-by graduation ceremony</a>, which featured very emotional moments.</p><p class=fh>The Bravo star also has another daughter Farrah Aldjufrie, 31, from a previous marriage to Guraish Aldjufrie. Farrah holds a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Southern California. She is currently working as the director of client relations in her stepfather's company.</p><p class=fh>Richards and Umansky have managed to build a closely-knit blended family, and the "RHOBH" star's social media is brimming with photos of her family creating unforgettable memories.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>THEIR LONG-LASTING MARRIAGE</strong></p><p class=fh>Recently, social media <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/29/rhobh-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-closer-than-ever-online-rumors/>was awash with rumors</a> of a possible split for the inseparable couple. The news came as a shock to many because Richards and Umansky's marriage had never seemed threatened.</p><p class=fh>Thankfully, sources close to the couple confirmed that the reports of a troubled marriage were nothing but rumors. And the couple looked inseparable during a bike ride in Aspen in September. They also enjoyed a vacation trip to Cabo.</p><p class=fh>Richards later addressed the rumors regarding her marriage during an October interview<a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kyle-richards-reacts-to-mauricio-umansky-split-rumors/> with Us Weekly</a>. The mother of four claimed in the past such things would have weighed her down, but now she takes it with a pinch of salt.</p><p class=fh>The 51-year-old TV personality took to her Instagram page to post a sweet tribute in honor of her husband. While sharing a series of throwback photos, she<a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7jGxBQnW3r/?utm_source=ig_embed"> wrote:</a></p><p class=fh>"It's hard to believe this was taken 24 years ago today.

She claimed one of the key things in her marriage is their uniformity on fundamental issues, especially how they choose to raise their children.</p><p class=fh>Richards' eldest daughter Farrah was born a few years before she got married to Umansky. She has witnessed the union through the years and has more than enough to say about the couple. Farrah recently gave her take on the couple, <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/did-rhobh-change-kyle-richards-marriage-to-mauricio-umansky>saying</a>:</p><p class=fh>"They have set such a great example for couples, married couples, people in relationships because they truly are a team."</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>BECOMING A TEENAGE MOM</strong></p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Kyle Richards </a>was born in Los Angeles, California,<a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0724202/bio> to Kathleen Mary Dugan</a> and businessman Kenneth Edwin Richards.
