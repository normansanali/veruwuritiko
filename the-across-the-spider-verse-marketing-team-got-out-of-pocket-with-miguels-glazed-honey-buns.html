Here, we have a character whose place in the story is informed by his conflicting viewpoint, as opposed to his personal motivations. Yes, he might be “the one Spider-Man that doesn’t have a sense of humor,” as Oscar Isaac would describe him, but even that doesn’t get in the way of O’Hara turning into one of the most compelling comic book characters in recent memory.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>The more you think about his character, the more you understand why he did what he did in Across the Spider-Verse. In fact, now that we’ve watched the movie, this might be the perfect opportunity to reflect more on Miguel O’Hara, and what better way to do that than when you’re having a cup of coffee or, say, a glazed honey bun?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGaZk6e8tL%2BMrZ%2BeZaOltqWx0WatnqqjmnqurdGknK2hnpx6tbHApmSgp6RivLbAjKidZqifmLimwIywoK2gXaK2qMHEpapmn5yWx6awjKGmp52pYq%2B2utJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teihotu-brando-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Teihotu Brando Net Worth</span></a>
