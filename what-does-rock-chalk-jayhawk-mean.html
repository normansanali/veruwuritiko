Chemistry professor E.H.S. Bailey created the first version, which consisted of repeating "Rah, Rah, Jayhawk, KU" three times.</p><p>Later, an English professor at the university suggested swapping the "rahs" with "Rock Chalk" to reference chalk rock. For those unaware, chalk rock is the name for "the limestone outcropping found on Mount Oread, site of the Lawrence campus."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In a video discussing the history of the famous chant, E.H.S. Bailey's granddaughter, class of 1937 member Carolyn Bailey Bernekin, said she would "like to have new students know that this yell, the KU 'Rock Chalk' chant, is the first thing that brought KU together as a body." She added that "it's sung everywhere there's a group of students."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The "Rock Chalk" chant was performed at the 1920 Olympics for the King of Belgium.</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KC Kingdom</a>, during the 1920 Olympics, the King of Belgium requested to hear what a typical college yell sounded like. All of the athletes assembled and agreed that the "Rock Chalk" chant was the only option. As a result, they gathered together and performed it for him.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=#>President Teddy Roosevel</a>t deemed the "Rock Chalk, Jayhawk" chant as the greatest of all time — this makes sense, seeing as he was quite the science fanatic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXae8pLeMnJ%2BapJtit6LFx5qupGWdmq6v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lively-and-reynolds-married-at-a-notebook-house-html.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Got Married at a House From The Notebook</span></a>
