Daly's jiggered career -- from arthritis that forced him to ride a golf cart, to his eccentric habits, to the simply jaw-dropping failures of discipline -- reads like a bizarre parable of obsession with talent and chaos.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Unconventional Approach</h2><p>John Daly, two-time Major champion, has always sparked conversation. Daly has still been able to play — defying limitations with the physical barrier to competing in the sport he loves. The atypical maneuver has been the subject of debate in the golf community—critics think the use of carts gives him a competitive advantage, while others realize the struggles he faces with his arthritis.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Rule-Breaking Incidents</h2><p>Daly's career has been clouded by a variety of misdeeds -- from whacking golf balls off the top of a beer can during a pro-am to using alcohol, and tobacco, and nearly clipping a Firearms officer with his car after blowing through a security checkpoint. Many of these incidents have led to run-ins with the PGA Tour, including fines, suspensions, and mandated counseling or rehab.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Most notoriously, in the 1994 World Series of Golf, Daly was fined $20,000 and suspended for the rest of the 1994 Tour season after an altercation with another player turned into a fistfight. These moments have branded Daly as a loose cannon, bucking the established norms of the decorum of the sport.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Impact and Perception</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>The only thing unconventional about Daly has been his lifestyle and his aversion to the rules that govern the life of a professional golfer.&nbsp;Daly&nbsp;is both admired for his resilience in the face of adversity and his ability to connect with fans and rebuked for his behavior. Some say the PGA Tour should have taken a harder line amid a movement across sports to come down on bad behavior but the result is a sigh of relief for people within the golf industry. His actions have impacted more than just the fairways, but have helped to influence how golfers are viewed as both athletes and public figures.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Daly: Love Him or Hate Him</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Daly has been a polarizing figure among fans and critics throughout his career. His big-hitting ability plus his rugged personality have made him a fan favorite with those who like their golfers real and raw. On the other hand, his rule-breaking episodes have provoked the wrath of those who insist on the importance of playing within the etiquette and decorum of the sport of golf.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Unpredictable Maverick</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>That difference is Daly is a wild card and takes shots at the establishment. Ebullient and iconic, with a game both startling and startle-proof, his path -- filled with wins and wobbles -- has brought an element of the unknown to the golf course, always-fascinated fans drawn to his loud, larger-than-life image from the gallery by his unconventional stylings.<br data-mce-fragment=1>The unique and unusual style and method of golf that John Daly plays has made him a controversial person in the golfing world. His run-ins with the rules and his unconventional manners have provoked great discussions about golfers as both athletes and public figures. Regardless of those feelings, Daly is forever etched into golf history, an impossibility to ignore in the landscape of the sport.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mieqKSWZLewtM1mm5qkqWLEqa3TZqSanJVitaq5jKymZqCRqbKl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacque-vaughn-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jacque Vaughn Net Worth</span></a>
