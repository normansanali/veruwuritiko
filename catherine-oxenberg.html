Van Dien and Oxenberg have two daughters together: <a href=#>Maya Van Dien</a> (born 2001) and Celeste Alma Van Dien (born 2003).</p><p>Oxenberg acknowledged, in November 2017, that she had interactions with <a href=#>Keith Raniere</a> and his NXIVM organization, bringing her daughter India into NXIVM in 2011 for what she thought would be "a self-help, business-oriented program". Oxenberg confirmed that her daughter became heavily involved in the cult, and that she had initiated what proved to be a failed intervention for India. In August 2018, Oxenberg revealed that India had left NXIVM in June, after the arrest of Raniere, and they were working on their relationship. In August 2018, Oxenberg's book Captive: A Mother's Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult was published.</p><p>As of 2011, Oxenberg was 3936th in the line of succession to the throne of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Realms.</p><p>Oxenberg was portrayed by <a href=#>Rachael Taylor</a> in the 2005 telemovie Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure, a fictionalized retelling of the behind-the-scenes goings-on during the production of Dynasty.
