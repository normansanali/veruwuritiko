I actually can’t think of many examples across&nbsp;Star Wars media that have him capeless. He’s even wearing it the very moment he awakens in Revenge of the Sith.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>But now, a behind the scenes photo from a rehearsal take&nbsp;gives us a rare look at a capeless Vader, as well as revealing a little bit of movie magic about how the costume works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/display-2.jpg><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>As you can see, the cape isn’t just there for style points, it also conceals a battery pack that powers the lights on the costume. And, if I’m looking at this correctly, it seems that Darth Vader is powered by five or six D-cell batteries. That looks heavy and seems like overkill to power a couple of lights on a costume, but then again, I’m sure they had their reasons for designing it this way. Plus, whether it be David Prowse or Bob Anderson in the costume, both men were burly enough to be able to lug this around all day.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>As an aside, I also like that we get to see a helmetless Stormtrooper in the background. Maybe this was taken on casual Friday at the Death Star?</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=false>There’ve been several unsubstantiated rumors that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker will make some kind of appearance</a> in <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars: Episode IX</a></strong>, whether it be as a force ghost, a hallucination or in a flashback. It seems like an outside bet to me, but given that the cast have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite explicit that the film is the end of the Skywalker saga</a>, who knows? Either way, I’m not going to complain if Vader stalks the silver screen for one final hurrah come December 20th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGdk6B6s63RnmSsrJGnerit0axkqaCfqbxusMCrq6Flppaxpr6MnJipnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./psa-1-vs-psa-10-determining-the-better-graded-trading-card.html><span>←</span><span>PSA 1 vs PSA 10: Determining the Better Graded Trading Card?</span></a>
