Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_and_Debut>Career Beginnings and Debut</span></h2><p>Brandi Carlile began her singing career by performing in Seattle music clubs with twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth, who were part of the band Fighting Machinists.</p><p>Columbia Records signed her in 2004 on the strength of songs she had been recording periodically at home. She released her songs in 2005 and showcased those early songs along with newly recorded tracks in the album Brandi Carlile.</p><p>Then in 2006, Columbia Records re-released them and also included re-recordings of Throw It All Away and What Can I Say.</p><p>Her album earned enthusiastic reviews and Rolling Stone featured her on its “10 Artists to Watch in 2005” list. Interview and Paste also included her on the “artists to watch” lists.</p><p>The album also peaked at No. 80 on Billboard 200 and reached No. 1 on US Folk Albums.</p><p>Soon after the release of the album, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers. She worked with them on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours.</p><p>The tightly knit trio forms the core of her band today and they spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that later became part of her album The Story.</p><p>By the end of 2006, she had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists like Tori Amos, The Fray, Ray LaMontagne, Chris Isaak, and Shawn Colvin.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>A songwriter whose yearning, probing spirit is matched by her powerful, soaring voice, Brandi Carlile made a splash with her self-titled debut album in 2005.</p><p>Yet the mainstream acclaim was so sudden, that it almost seemed as if it arrived overnight when she received six Grammy nominations for her 2018 album titled, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">By the Way, I Forgive You</a>.</p><p>Between those two albums, she had her share of success. The haunted, churning The Story won her a gold certification for the album of the same name.</p><p>But she worked steadily and reliably, building up a cult audience and industry connections that all crested with, By the Way, I Forgive You.</p><p>Her visibility elevated and she capitalized on her stardom by joining Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, and Natalie Hemby in the country supergroup the High Women. Its 2019 debut helped underscore her stardom and artistic depth.</p><h4>In the 2000s</h4><p>Then in 2000, she recorded the first of several self-released recordings that sold briskly at shows. By the year 2005, she gained enough buzz to secure a contract with Columbia Records, which released her self-titled debut later that same year.</p><p>The album earned enthusiastic reviews. The next year, she and her band began work on her second Columbia album, The Story, with T-Bone Burnett producing.</p><p>Give Up the Ghost followed in late 2009 and cracked the Top 40, featuring production from another high-caliber studio hand, Rick Rubin, as well as a duet with childhood idol Elton John.</p><p>She rang in 2010 by issuing a Valentine’s Day-themed EP, XOBC. She also continued to tour, making a well-received stop at the annual Bonnaroo Festival that summer and collaborating with the Seattle Symphony for two shows in November.</p><p>The symphonic concerts were recorded and released the following year as Live at Benaroya Hall.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-33911 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brandi-Carlile-with-the-Highwomen.jpg alt="Brandi Carlile" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-33911 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Brandi with the Highwomen at the Red Carpet of CMA.

They released it in the first week of March 2015 and earned Brandi Carlile her first Grammy nomination for Best American Album.</p><p>Then in 2017, she commemorated the tenth anniversary of The Story by assembling a star-studded charity album for the nonprofit “War Child, Cover Stories: She Celebrates 10 Years of the Story”.</p><p>Moreover, inspired by an Adele cover of “Hiding My Heart,” this album also featured Dolly Parton, Pearl Jam, Kris Kristofferson, Jim James, and the Avett Brothers, among many others.</p><h4>After 2015</h4><p>She returned with her sixth studio album titled By the Way I Forgive You. It was co-produced by Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings in February 2018. This LP became Carlile’s highest-charting outing to date.</p><p>Similarly, in October 2018, she teamed up with English singer/songwriter Sam Smith for a lush orchestral version of the album Closer “Party of One”. Two months later, she received six Grammy nominations.</p><p>This included three of the biggest categories, “Album of the Year”, “Record of the Year”, and “Song of the Year”. She took home three trophies. They were for the album, By the Way, I Forgive You.&nbsp;</p><p>The album won “Best Americana Album”, and The Joke scored “Best American Roots Song” and “Best American Roots Performance”.</p><p>Then in early 2019, she was featured on country singer Maren Morris’ second album, Girl.
