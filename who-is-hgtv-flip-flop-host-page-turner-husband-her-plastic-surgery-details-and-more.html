Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Page has not yet been married and does not have a husband. On the other hand, the Flip Flop Host had a long-term relationship with her TV program companion, DeRon Jenkins.</p><p>They met in 2008 and dated for quite some time before breaking up.</p><p>Despite this, the two reconciled and maintained their relationship within a short time after their breakup and appeared together on camera once again.</p><p>On the other hand, Page has three intelligent and attractive daughters, Quincy, Qai, and Zaire. Because Page has made no mention of her marriage or married life, it’s safe to assume that her daughters are from her early relationships.</p><p>Also, Page has not been listed on the Wikipedia page yet. However, there is a Wikipedia page on the name of Flip or Flop Nashville where we can find some information on Page.</p><h2 id=fact-check-did-page-turner-had-a-plastic-surgery-rumor-or-truth><span class=ez-toc-section id=fact-check-did-page-turner-had-a-plastic-surgery-rumor-or-truth></span> Fact Check: Did Page Turner Had A Plastic Surgery?

Page has also made no mention of her body or facial modifications.</p><p>She looks to be a natural beauty with a shining smile on her face.</p><p>Because no proof of her having plastic surgery is available, it must be taken as a rumor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ascension.

So far, her actual net worth has remained unknown.</p><p>However, her net worth is estimated to be at USD 3 million, according to celebritydig, following her successful time on Flip or Flop Nashville.</p><p>Nonetheless, because no formal announcement has been made, it is only an estimate of her fortune.</p><p>On the other hand, a real estate broker makes an average of $219K a year. As a result, Page must have amassed a substantial amount of property and net worth from her full pay to this point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yhnq2uXZu5qryMn6OoqF2dvLTAjKmYoJ1dqcKzusSrZKGto5eur7CMoZyrZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxYydnK2ZmaHAbq3NnWSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./civ6-map-mods.html><span>←</span><span>The Ultimate Collection FandomSpot</span></a>
