<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Logitech Launches G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse with A New 6000 DPI Sensor</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Logitech this month introduced its new G203 Prodigy gaming mouse that combines a classic aesthetic with a high-resolution sensor, programmable buttons and RGB LED lighting. What is important is that the mouse is considerably less expensive than typical gaming mice.</p><p>Computer mice have greatly evolved in the past decade as manufacturers try to offer better ergonomics for different types of users and applications. Many mice today feature additional buttons and/or a rather fancy shape because their producers try to address hardcore gamers or prosumers looking for maximum comfort during their many-hour game or work sessions, with many users preferring different grips and layouts. The Logitech G203 Prodigy is promoted as a departure from the concept of complex design and we are told it brings ergonomics back to basics - the new mouse is made to resemble&nbsp;a simplistic shape that popular mice are known for, but we are told it can be done without sacrificing usability.</p><p>The Logitech G203 Prodigy is based on one of the company’s in-house-customized sensors with on-the-fly adjustable resolution (200-6000 DPI) along with an ARM processing core that supports USB report rate of 1000 Hz (appropriate software is required for relevant operating systems). Just as in the&nbsp;case of the higher end devices, the G203 Prodigy can be completely reprogrammed using Logitech’s software and then used on different PCs since button configuration is stored inside the mouse. Finally, developers of the G203 could not ignore the trend and installed a programmable RGB LED into the G logotype on the mouse.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/11053/logitech_prodigy_1_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>One of the important aspects of the Logitech G203 Prodigy is its price: the company sells it for $39.99 in the U.S. and for €44.99 in the E.U., which is below the price of typical gaming mice that may retail for well over $100. Knowing that Logitech <a href=#>develops</a>&nbsp;various product designs, high-resolution sensors and other components in-house, it is likely that the creation of the G203 Prodigy is a response to the demand of potential customers rather than an attempt to address a lower-end market segment currently controlled by various bulk production companies with a cheap product. The G203 Prodigy is made in Switzerland and thus passes all the rigorous <a href=#>tests</a> that Logitech uses to promote the&nbsp;quality of its products.</p><p>As pointed out on Twitter by <a href=#>@AfterPad</a>, this is an update to the previous generation <a href=#>Logitech G102</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, an interesting thing to consider is that the price of the Logitech G203 Prodigy will be very attractive not only to gamers who do not need fancy design, adjustable weight or plenty of additional buttons, but also makers of higher-end PCs designed for gamers. The G203 Prodigy is the most affordable gaming mouse from the company and thus becomes a good candidate to be supplied with pre-built systems.</p><p>Related Reading:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5yfJRsZqWnl57Bpq%2FHZqOarZ6Ytaa%2FjKBpaWtdpb%2BwsMigsGafkaK2r7OMpqauq5VixKrAx2aapZmjqLakecuopqRlkaOxboKPaWdmnKCeerSxzaymqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-sanchez.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Snchez - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</span></a>
