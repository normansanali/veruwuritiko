Popeil was born on May 3, 1935, to a Jewish family in Manhattan, borough of New York, New York, United States, and grew up in New York City. His parents divorced when he was six years old, and he and his brother were sent to live with his grandparents in Florida for the summer. When he was 17, he came to Chicago with his grandparents to work for his father, Samuel Popeil, in his company’s manufacturing facility (Popeil Brothers). Ron Popeil’s grandparents eventually went to Florida, and he stayed with his father.</p><p>After high school, Popeil enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he joined Alpha Epsilon Pi before dropping out after six months.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Ronald M.

He then married Lisa Boehne, with whom he had a daughter, and the couple has two additional children. Ron had two more daughters with Robin Angers after they married. He and Boehne divorced around 1995, when he married Robin Angers. His aunt and uncle were Ashley Tisdale and Jennifer Tisdale, respectively.</p><h2><span id=Ron_Popeil8217s_Professional_Career>Ron Popeil’s Professional Career</span></h2><p>Popeil learnt his trade from his father, who designed and sold a number of culinary devices to prominent department stores, including the Chop-O-Matic and the Veg-O-Matic. The Chop-O-Matic cost $3.98 and sold over two million copies. It was so good at slicing vegetables that it was impractical for salespeople to carry what they needed for their pitches. The solution was to record it on video. Before founding Ronco in 1964, Ron worked as a dealer for his father’s culinary supplies. He retained his father’s distributorship while also adding products from other manufacturers. Ron and his father (Samuel) competed for the same retail store in the 1970s. He presently serves on the UC Los Angeles Business, Management, and Legal Advisory Boards.</p><p>He sold Ronco to Fi-Tek VII, a Denver holding company, for $55 million in August 2005 in order to continue as the company’s spokesman and inventor while spending more time with his family. Ronco’s housewares section alone generated approximately $8 million in sales in the United States. Popeil is well-known for a number of items, notably the Chop-O-Matic hand food processor, which it both distributes and manufactures. The company created the 5in1 Turkey Fryer & Food Cooking System, as well as the Giant Dehydrator and Beef Jerky Machine. Following Ron’s departure from the firm, his son Mike went on to invent devices such as the Dial-O’Matic, the Veg-successor. Ron Popeil, the designer of Matic’s The Chop-O-Matic hand food processor, may have been the basis for comedian Gallagher’s “Sledge O’Matic.”</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 0” –&nbsp;</strong>in Centimeters&nbsp;<strong>– 183 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 78 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 171 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Gray</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Ron Popeil has 16.1K followers and 3,206 followers on Instagram, where he had 145 posts.
