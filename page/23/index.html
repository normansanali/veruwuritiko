A sometimes unwanted side effect of living one’s life as a celebrity is the fact that many fans feel entitled to know every detail of one’s personal life. Every actor, musician, and well-known creative has to make a personal decision about how to handle this and what they will allow to be public knowledge. It’s a difficult balancing act, but one that actor Constance Wu handles with imperfect grace.
