<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>10 Best Movies And TV Shows Starring Sasha Lane</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Sasha Lane made a great impression in Andrea Arnold’s American Honey, which served as her acting debut. She received multiple nominations for indie cinema prizes for this performance, and she even won the British Independent Film Awards, launching a bright career. Lane has since continued to work primarily on small, independent films and has dabbled with a few TV projects. Together with Halsey, she has appeared in music videos for Alicia Keys, Lewis Capaldi, LA Poolside, and If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power.</p><p>She is not a one-trick pony, and it is clear that the projects she stars in are carefully chosen since they are all distinctive from one another. In addition to her work in the costume department for films and television, Lane has contributed to the Marvel’s Wastelanders: Hawkeye podcast and a music video for the band Neon Indian. She also plays Hunter C-20 in Marvel’s Loki series, a role she was cast in after trying out for one of the Spider-Man movies.</p><p>Here are Sasha Lane’s top 10 films and TV shows, ranked, for those who are curious about her filmography or for those who are already fans but want to dig further.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> After Everything (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Amazing Stories (2020)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> American Honey (2016)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Conversations with Friends (2022)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Daniel Isn’t Real (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Hearts Beat Loud (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Hellboy (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> How to Blow Up a Pipeline (2022)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> The Miseducation of Cameron Post (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Utopia (2020)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=After_Everything_2018>After Everything (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/after-everything-movie-still.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hanna Marks and Joey Power are the team behind the writing and directing of After Everything. In it, Jeremy Allen White plays a young guy whose cancer diagnosis alters the course of his life. The figure of Maika Monroe, who is unafraid of his latest diagnosis, enters his life just after his relationship fails. Even though the film has glaring flaws, they do not detract from its powerful attractiveness. The portrayal of people having to endure heartbreaking circumstances earlier than anticipated in life has a poignancy. Sasha Lane brings humour and believable support to the universe of After Everything by playing the character of a friend.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Amazing_Stories_2020>Amazing Stories (2020)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sasha-lane-in-amazing-stories.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A Steven Spielberg anthology series from the 1980s was reimagined in Amazing Tales. This time around, it stars actors like Victoria Pedretti, Dylan O’Brien, and Robert Forster, as well as filmmakers like Mark Mylod (Succession) and Susanna Fogel (The Flight Attendant). Michael Dinner is the director and Adam Horowitz is the writer of the Sasha Lane episode, “Signs of Life.”</p><p>Lane plays Alia, whose mother has just emerged from a six-year coma and has no memory of her previous existence. Lane’s performance in this episode stands out among numerous forgettable ones. She gives the show great emotional weight and grounds the plot, which at times threatens to wander. This remake, like Hellboy, looks pointless, but it also provided Lane a chance to show off some great acting choices.</p><h3><span id=American_Honey_2016>American Honey (2016)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/americanhoneyjpeg-d00f2f4d6c17d441.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>American Honey, Lane’s debut feature, is still her best work. Together with Riley Keough as Krystal and Shia LaBeouf as Jake, she plays the part of Star. They are part of a cross-country sales team that engages in partying, dating, and illegal activities. According to Lane, she got the job entirely by <a href=#>accident</a>. The film’s director, Andrea Arnold, approached her while she was in Miami and inquired about her interest in the part.</p><p>The end product is a magnificent film with an intense and lovely atmosphere, thanks in large part to Lane’s main performance. The fact that Lane hasn’t yet outdone this performance doesn’t reflect poorly on the rest of her career; rather, it only serves as evidence that American Honey is simply superior.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Conversations_with_Friends_2022>Conversations with Friends (2022)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/02f169af2100bed6764c6fe832604aba8c-conversations-with-friends-ep-012xrsocialw600jpg.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Conversations with Friends is another project with a colossal precedent after Normal People, the first TV adaptation of a Sally Rooney novel, which became an unexpected hit in 2020. Together with Alison Oliver as Frances, Jemima Kirke as Melissa, and Joe Alwyn as Nick, Lane plays Bobbi in this instance. The cast and crew had a challenge because Frances’ interiority was such a prominent theme in Rooney’s novel.</p><p>The show has many positive aspects, Oliver and Lane are both top-notch actors, and their friendship—which is essential to the plot—is effectively portrayed. The fact that Frances and Bobbi’s relationship is the most compelling aspect of the adaptations is a testament to how well the two actors portray complex relationships that rely on many things being left unsaid. Overall, though, the programme lacks vigour and finds it difficult to maintain the romantic intensity that infuses its original material.</p><h3><span id=Daniel_Isn8217t_Real_2019>Daniel Isn’t Real (2019)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sasha-lane-in-daniel-isn-t-real.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Luke, portrayed by Miles Robbins in Daniel Isn’t Real, has undergone terrible trauma and creates an imagined childhood companion to help him cope. Patrick Schwarzenegger plays this friend Daniel; Cassie is portrayed by Lane; and, coincidentally, Sophie is portrayed by Hannah Marks, the co-director of After Everything. Luke quickly comes to the conclusion that Daniel is more of a threat to his safety than an aid to his predicament.</p><p>The film is a skillfully executed psychological horror that, rather than being constrained by its limited resources, makes the most of them. It’s a lot of fun, with a compelling story that could veer off course at the conclusion, but not in a way that detracts from the rest of the picture.</p><h3><span id=Hearts_Beat_Loud_2018>Hearts Beat Loud (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sasha-lane-and-kiersey-clemons-in-hearts-beat-loud.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hearts Beat Loud is a complete 180 from Daniel Isn’t Real. It tells the tale of a father and daughter who collaborate on <a href=#>songs</a> before the latter leaves for college. Nick Offerman portrays the father, and Kiersey Clemons the daughter. Rose, the girlfriend of Clemons’ Sam, plays Lane’s part.</p><p>You will feel warm after seeing this peaceful, charming, and lovely film. The cast is rich in talent and charm, so the narrative authenticity doesn’t grate as much as it could have in other hands. In this understated tale, everything seems natural. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Lane reveals that Hearts Beat Loud was the first book in which she felt she could relate to a character “on every single level,” highlighting the sincerity of this sweet tale.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Hellboy_2019>Hellboy (2019)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sasha-lane-in-hellboy.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The Hellboy adaptation created by The Descent’s director Neil Marshall was released in 2019. Guillermo del Toro was the director of the first two films, which were released in 2004 and 2009, and they earned excellent reviews. This time, Lane and Daniel Dae-Kim portray David Harbour’s sidekicks as David Harbour takes the lead. Marshall’s rendition, though, may have been doomed from the beginning because it has a lot to live up to, and it can’t possibly compare to the originals. It was a completely pointless remake that was also poorly made. Although Lane is a skilled performer, the material is plain unsuitable. A choppy writing makes it difficult for Lane and her co-stars to develop any kind of genuine chemistry, and the action never really gets going.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=How_to_Blow_Up_a_Pipeline_2022>How to Blow Up a Pipeline (2022)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-cast.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>How to Blow Up a Pipeline, an environmental thriller, centres on a group of activists organising a perilous expedition to blow up an oil pipeline. Here, Lane reteams with Forrest Goodluck, who she previously worked with on the Cameron Post project. They also appear alongside Ariela Barer, Kristen Froseth, and Lukas Gage. The chemistry and tension created by this group of actors is excellent.</p><p>One of the most thrilling and new thrillers we’ve recently read, How to Bomb Up a Pipeline seems urgent. It doesn’t hold back when it comes to delving deeply into its climate discussions and delivers on all fronts, including thrills, suspense, and twists.</p><h3><span id=The_Miseducation_of_Cameron_Post_2018>The Miseducation of Cameron Post (2018)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-cast-of-the-miseducation-of-cameron-post.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Desiree Akhavan is the director of the film adaptation of Emily M. Danforth’s book, The Miseducation of Cameron Post. Cameron, a high school student who is found with her lover and sent to a conversion therapy camp, is portrayed by Chloe Grace Moretz in the film. She meets Adam, played by Forrest Goodluck, and Jane, a character played by Lane, while there.</p><p>The film achieves a delicate balance between difficult subject matter and a decent dose of <a href=#>dark comedy</a> thanks to Akhavan’s screenplay and directing. The friendship that Cameron develops with Jane and Adam is encouraging and adds a crucial touch of hope to this tragic tale. These lighter scenes are also crucial to completing the world’s realism since even in extremely upsetting circumstances like this, individuals will still manage to laugh.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Utopia_2020>Utopia (2020)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sasha-lane-in-utopia.jpg alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The television programme Utopia is the creation of Gillian Flynn, author of <a href=#>Gone Girl</a> and Sharp Objects. It centres on a group of internet buddies who find a copy of a graphic novel that has a cult following. As a result, they have to save the globe while dodging the attentions of an evil organisation. The show also features John Cusack, Ashleigh LaThrop, and Rainn Wilson in addition to Lane, who plays Jessica.</p><p>The plot’s unexpected turns and the show’s brutality have proven to be contentious with viewers. Those who could get into it had a lot more fun than those who thought the show was <a href=#>offensive</a> and excessive. Thus, depending on your preferences, you might love or detest this show, but Lane’s work is undeniably fantastic in both cases.</p><h3></h3><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="sasha calle movies and tv shows,sasha compère movies and tv shows,sara lane movies and tv shows,sasha alexander movies and tv shows,samantha win movies and tv shows,sasha jenson movies and tv shows,sasha rojen movies and tv shows" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
