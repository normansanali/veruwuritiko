まさかまさかの結婚の報告に多くの人が感激してることでしょう。
長く体調不良で休んでいた越智志帆さんは、
昨年の２０１７年１１月に１０周年で奇跡の復活を遂げました。
念願の復活を遂げた後に結婚の報告とは、
人生逆転とは、このようなことなのかと感心します・・・。
越智志帆(Superfly)が金澤ダイスケ(フジファブリック)と結婚 結婚を発表した越智志帆さんですが、
その旦那さんが驚きの方なのです。
なんと越智志帆さんは金澤ダイスケさんと交際しており、
彼と結婚したのです！
越智志帆さんとフジファブリックの金澤さん・・・、
かなり驚きの組み合わせです。
互いにミュージシャンということなので、
今後はステージで共演する機会に期待したいです。
この日午後8時過ぎに、「突然のご報告となりますが、私Superfly 越智志帆は、フジファブリック 金澤ダイスケさんと結婚いたしました。穏やかで、思いやりがあり、とってもユニークな方です。」と報告した越智。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180417-00010004-spht-ent
越智志帆さんは金澤さんの、
・穏やか
・思いやり
・ユーモラス
の３点に惹かれたそうです。
音楽性にしたら越智志帆さんとは違いますが、
性格というか、人間的な部分では共通の何かを感じる二人です。
互いに一途で愛情深いイメージがあるので、
かなりお似合いのように思えます。
互いのファンも二人の結婚に対しては、
祝福のコメントを多く送っており、
皆に応援される幸せな夫婦になりそうです。
結婚できないまま３０代に突入し、
正直、ファン的には越智志帆さんの私生活が心配でした。
仕事にストイックで、常に音楽活動ばかりの彼女にとって、
同じ畑の旦那さんをゲットしたことは、大きな恩恵になります。。
彼氏彼女としての交際期間と馴れ初め(画像) しかし、気になるのは越智志帆さんと金澤さんの馴れ初めです。
一体、いつどこで知り合って、どのような形で交際が始まったのでしょうか？
越智志帆さんの声明を読んでいると、
馴れ初めは１年前になるそうです。
だとしたら、割とスピード婚なのかも？
「出会って1年ほどですが、おじいちゃん・おばあちゃんになっても笑って楽しく過ごせる気がしています。これからの毎日、嬉しい事、楽しい事、悲しい事、苦しい事、、、色んな場面があると思いますが、陰ながらサポートしていけたらと思っております。環境は変わりますが、今まで以上にエネルギッシュな楽曲や歌声をお届けしたいと思っておりますので楽しみにしていてください。」とファンにメッセージを送った。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180417-00010004-spht-ent
それでも２０代を音楽に突っ走ってきた越智志帆さんからすると、
体調不良で１年以上休んだ１年弱は長い日々で、
その時期に知り合い、交際した金澤さんは、
人生の中でもとびきり特別な方であるのです。
これからSuperflyの新曲が出るにしても、
休んでいた時間での濃い大恋愛を連想さす、
熱くて素敵な恋愛ソングも聴けるかも？
フジファブリックもSuperflyも、
互いを高め合って、日本の音楽界をリードしていってほしいですね！
まだ子供ができたような話はありませんが、
高齢出産になる前に、早く妊娠と出産を済ませてほしいです。
仕事でも私生活でも良いことが重なって、
ファンはホッとしていることでしょうね。。
これからの発表される金澤さんのコメントも楽しみです！
