Drake with Sean Combs, 2014. If there‚Äôs a poet laureate of pettiness today, it would have to be Drake. As an artist whose rhetoric is laced with incessant reconsideration of slights real and perceived and whose hostility mostly manifests in open-ended, passive-aggressive asides, the Toronto superstar has built no small portion of his reputation through appealing to the less passionate but more common aspects of the self. He longed after people without committing himself to loving them; he was always sad but never depressed; he was frequently annoyed but never enraged.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Funniest Reactions to the Earthquake that Rocked the East Coast</h2><time>Sep 16, 2024</time>
