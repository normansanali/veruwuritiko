This is not the first time--You tried to get away
This is not a party--Where people know your name
This is not a classroom--With teacher at the board
This is not a catshow--With prizes at the doorChorus

Won't you stay with me one more day
If we get through one more night
If we get through one more night
This is not a horse race--Where winners beat the time</article><article class=post-entry><h2>7 Medical Shows on Netflix That Are Worth Your Time</h2><time>Jul 22, 2024</time>
