<a href=../../../../whos-on-top-of-the-movie-shark-food-chain-html.html></a>
Despite the ardent efforts of nature conservancy activists to rebrand them as the gentle giants of the sea, moviegoers have long been convinced that sharks are ruthless killing machines without a shred of honor or mercy. The cinematic imagination has long feared these toothy rulers of the briny deep, their bloodlust fueling Steven Spielberg’s proto-blockbuster Jaws as well as the dozens upon dozens of imitators that would offer their own tweaks on the formula to varying degrees of success.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>WIU offers in-person counseling for students</h2><time>Oct 1, 2024</time>

Come And Find Me&nbsp;endears in a very Charlie Countryman kind of way (if Shia’s flick was your thing), where love&nbsp;motivates a regular Joe&nbsp;to throw himself to the proverbial lions. Think Mr. And Mrs. Smith, except only the wife is an assassin, and the husband is nothing but urban camouflage (aka cover). Writer/Director&nbsp;Zack Whedon never loses the reality that his graphic-designing hero is in completely over his head, and makes a better thriller for it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Eddie Van Halen Passed Away At The Age Of 65</h2><time>Sep 30, 2024</time>
