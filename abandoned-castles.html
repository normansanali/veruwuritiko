But when the estate came under the ownership of Italian Marquis Ferdinando Ximenes Panciatichi, the palazzo was deemed too modest.</p><p>The marquis was determined to build a haven to escape the political turmoil in Italy at the time and so he had the Sammezzano Castle erected in its place in 1853.</p><p>The abandoned castle took nearly half a century to construct and since its completion, is nothing short of astounding. It houses 365 rooms, one for each day of the year and each with its own individual design, but the palace is unified under the vibrant Moorish Revival style.</p><p>Some of the most distinct rooms inside the castle are the Peacock Room, which is decked out in a colorful geometric pattern; the White Room, which features Moroccan tiled floors and wrought iron chandeliers; and a breathtaking Hall of Mirrors.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>The Sammezzano Castle was closed in the 1990s after it was briefly converted into a luxury hotel following the end of World War II.</span><span class=credit>savesammezzano/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>One of the most famous rooms inside the castle is the White Room, which features Moroccan mosaic tiled floors and wrought iron chandeliers.</span><span class=credit>savesammezzano/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>It took 40 years to complete this abandoned palace.</span><span class=credit>map_of_italy/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The centuries-old castle is currently up for sale — for $19 million.</span><span class=credit>elena_cavallin/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The castle was first constructed as a much smaller royal palazzo by its original owner Ximenes of Aragon in 1605.</span><span class=credit>savesammezzano/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The Italian Marquis Ferdinando Ximenes Panciatichi rebuilt Sammezzano as a peaceful refuge from the political upheaval in 19th-century Italy.</span><span class=credit>_antoniosurace_/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>Sammezzano features 365 rooms — one room for each day of the year — with different names and designs. </span><span class=credit>darryl_barton/Instagram</span> <span class=credit>Sammezzano Castle website</span> <span class=credit>_antoniosurace_/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>A group of locals advocating for the castle's preservation banded together to form a committee called FPXA 1813-2013, an acronym from its past owner Ferdinando Ximenes Panciatichi.</span><span class=credit>Sammezzano Castle website</span> <img decoding=async alt="Colorful Design" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/colorful-design.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Explore Sammezzano Castle View Gallery<p>It's clear that the eccentric marquis sought to create a space unlike anything that had come before it — and he succeeded.
