At that point, I knew right off the bat, I was gonna be your poor man’s Buzz Lightyear, which I was perfectly fine with. I just remember watching cartoons when I was a kid and the Saturday morning cartoons they’d come out and have a cartoon that was based on a movie and I always felt ripped off like, ‘That’s not the real voice. That’s a different voice.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lightyear-poster.jpg><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Warburton is used to playing impoverished versions of famous characters.
