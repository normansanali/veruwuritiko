"We give men this fantasy that they don’t really necessarily get at home," she explained. "It’s so many facets, so many entities wrapped up in the industry. And I think that’s why I love it so much."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">LeaLea on Beyond the Pole won’t keep her job a secret from her daughter, Maleah.</h2><p>While some of her co-workers prefer to hide what they do from friends and family, LeaLea revealed that she will tell her 4-year-old daughter the truth when she’s older.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE tv</span></figure><p>"Becoming a mom really, really defined what true and unconditional love was. For me, nothing compares to being a mom," she shared. "I’m going to be honest with [Maleah] because I feel like this is just the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think the earlier you talk to your kids about that and explain to them that this is just entertainment, the easier it becomes for everybody involved," she added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">LeaLea has no plans to stop stripping any time soon.</h2><p>Despite what some people say, LeaLea insists there’s no age limit when it comes to being an exotic dancer. "You can strip as long as you want to. Sometimes I feel like if you’re fine at 45, go in there and get it," the 10-year veteran expressed on one episode.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE tv</span></figure><p>Though she intended to stop at one point, life had other plans, she explained. "Now I am just going with the flow, living life one day at a time while simultaneously preparing for anything life throws my way," LeaLea revealed in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a>.</p><p>She also happens to be really good at it. "You have to be confident in this industry. I love that for as much as it takes, it gives too," she shared. "It’s a billion-dollar industry. You know, sex sells. Stripping has become so famous instead of infamous."</p><p>And LeaLea has a message for those intimidated by her success: "I am a very confident person. Yes, I’m happy all the time. Yes, I’m just me. Now if that just makes people gravitate to me and makes it appear that I like to be the center of attention, then that’s everybody else’s issue, not mine."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE tv</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">LeaLea continues to butt heads with mentor Stormy on Beyond the Pole.</h2><p>In the first few episodes, it’s obvious that LeaLea doubts Stormy’s ability to coach anyone to millionaire status. In fact, she accuses the best-selling author of tearing the women down.</p><p>"I don’t like my peace to be disturbed and I definitely didn’t want to portray that image that black women couldn’t stand in a room and empower each other," she said after one particularly intense exchange with Stormy.</p><p>Though she may not want the entrepreneur’s guidance, LeaLea does acknowledge the importance of asking for help when you need it. "We think that’s a taboo," she confessed in a conversation with fellow dancer Laina. "There is strength in admitting, 'Hey, I cannot do this by myself.'"</p><p>Watch LeaLea and the rest of the Beyond the Pole gang Thursdays at 10:30 p.m. ET on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobKiuMSaZJudqaS7pXnToZxmqJ%2Bhsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-jenner-flashes-abs-in-tiny-bikini-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Kendall Jenner Flashes Abs in Tiny Bikini: Photo</span></a>
