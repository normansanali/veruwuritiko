Naturally, Shadow quickly came to the rescue, and thus, episode 12 ended. So, what about episode 13?</p><h2 id=h-when-is-episode-13-of-the-eminence-in-shadow-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is episode 13 of The Eminence in Shadow coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Eminence-In-Shadow-2.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>I have some bad news for you: there is no episode 13. There never was. Despite the season ending in a ginormous plot twist, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 13 was never in the works</a> – which is surprising, considering season 1 ran for 20 whole episodes. The second season, however, was planned for 12 episodes from the start. Despite the sad news, we still have some good information on the horizon.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>A movie adaptation is being crafted as we speak. So while we’re understandably frustrated about the obvious lack of a thirteenth episode, at least we can rest assured knowing Shadow and Cid will be coming back, albeit on the silver screen. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if you’re still hoping to see even more of The Eminence in Shadow</a>, the novels are available on Yen Press.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmasmJq%2FpnnToZxmnZ2eu6a6wp5koqZdqLWisM6wZKydkai8r3mRZpypoaOksaZ5kGxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./even-estheticians-approve-of-these-7-silicone-facial-cleansing-brushes-on-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>Innerneed Silicone Face Cleanser and Massager Brushes Gently Cleanse Skin</span></a>
