How did this unknown killer shark movie beat out much more well known fare like The Summer I Turned Pretty; Red, White & Royal Blue; Dungeons & Dragons and Cocaine Bear? It wasn’t easy.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> spoke to the producers of the film to figure out just how this whole thing went down. Here’s something crazy: the movie was made for under $10 million. That’s the price of the craft table on a Christopher Nolan movie.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Also, it’s a Latino movie, which movie executives like to say aren’t viable. A good movie is a good movie, regardless of its bent. Look at Barbie, one of the most profitable movies ever and it was supposed to be a “movie for women.”</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Javier Chapa, a producer and head of Mucho Más Media, which kickstarted the movie, said, “no one has ever seen a genre shark movie with a Latino bent.”</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>“That’s where we saw the opportunity, given our company’s ethos is all about really supporting people of color on both sides of the camera — but also filling a highly underserved need in our community.”</p><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Here’s the logline:</p><p>“Oilman Paul Sturges’ idyllic family vacation turns into a living nightmare when they encounter a gigantic megalodon shark that will stop at nothing to protect its territory. Stranded and under constant attack, Paul and his family must somehow find a way to get back to shore alive before it strikes again.”</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>There’s also a supernatural aspect to the movie, as the shark might be the herald of the ancient Aztec god Tlaloc. Mexican-born director Adrian Grunberg, who directed Get the Gringo and Rambo: Last Blood, helmed the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>There were some issues with financing (the movie has 17 executive producers) but eventually the movie’s distribution rights eventually sold to Amazon.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Josh Lucas stars as the dad, and Fernanda Urrejola, Venus Ariel and Julio Cesar Cedillo fill out the rest of the cast. It was filmed in the Dominican Republic with a large water tank and manmade almost three story oil rig. Because there were kids involved, production time was limited.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>Oh and there was a COVID outbreak, which did the opposite of speeding up filming.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>“Water, kids and Covid — there was definitely some tough times,” Chapa said. “But I think these are the good times, to see what people are responding to, to see it at the top of the charts. These are the fruits of your labour.”</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>It’s a testament to the quality of the film that it snagged the number one spot with only one known star, no advertising, no soundtrack to promote, no T.V. spots and no splashy P.R. campaign. Chapa says a lot of that is due to the latino community.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>“That the Latino community doesn’t get a lot of support on films, it’s shocking to me. They are the most aggressive moviegoing audience, more than any other cohort. And to me, it’s the million-dollar question: why aren’t more people making films that are universal but that are by and for that community?”</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>The Black Demon is currently streaming on Amazon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGabopqutcHRnmSfnZGpwrOxjLCgraBdlruwwMeeqWajmaG5pr6MrJ%2BaqptitaK%2FjK2YpJ2eYq5ursitnGanpal6sLKMrZ%2BeZaCntq6xjK%2BgnZ2fYr%2BiusqipaCrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steam-deck-replacement-parts-price.html><span>←</span><span>You can now buy Steam Deck parts.
