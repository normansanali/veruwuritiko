Another mom at her daughter's dance class told her how <strong>Stephanie had claimed to have given birth to Delilah</strong>. "Stephanie was telling us all about the preeclampsia that she had, that she had a seizure after she was born,'" she recalled the other parent telling her. "This woman stole my birth story! My birth story that I went through."</p><p>Later in her video, Mrsbelleblake also comments that Stephanie "wasn't even in the picture when Delilah was born. Stephanie was in high school when Delilah was born." That's not all. Stephanie, the nightmare stepmom, also told people what inspired her to name her daughter. Honestly, you have to see the video to believe the level of insanity. <strong>Mrsbelleblake's post has racked up many comments and likes. Currently, she has over 811,000 likes on the video, and people are leaving fiery responses</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Honestly, that's insane. But also, how would dance class parents not know that you're the natural mother if you're involved?" one person asked. "Yeah, and that's how Delilah's stepmom got banned from all her extra-curricular…," another TikTok user said. Other comments on the post include, "I'd literally lose my mind, that's insane," "Stephanie was in HIGH SCHOOL when Delilah was born. OMG," and "It's giving baby reindeer." <strong>The comments on the post have noticed just how outrageous this story is, but there is a happy ending</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mom-resolves-her-crazy-situation-with-her-daughter-39-s-stepmom>Mom Resolves Her Crazy Situation With Her Daughter's Stepmom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nightmare-stepmom-1.jpg><p>Despite TikTok user Mrsbelleblake's post being recent, she noted in her caption that this was a reenactment of earlier events. Her caption reads, "I'm 1000% done #stepparents #cheater #husbandandwife #divorce Disclaimer: this is a reenactment inspired by my own experiences with domestic abuse. I am no longer around the people involved." She continued, "This is to bring awareness to the Safe At Home Program (Address Confidentiality Program). This program provides a decoy address to victims of domestic abuse so their abusers can't find them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/80s-parents-dancing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="I Dare You Not To Laugh At These 80s Parents Showcasing Their Dancing Skills">I Dare You Not To Laugh At These 80s Parents Showcasing Their Dancing Skills</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>These '80s parents and their dance moves might make Gen Z kids cringe, but we can definitely relate to them!</p><p>The situation happened to her, but it's since been resolved, as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed in a follow-up video</a>. In the comments, she replied to a fan who asked if she had got full custody by writing "Yes." She also said the incident occurred "a few years" earlier, and the people involved in the story were no longer in her life. "So your ex isn't a part of your life anymore?" a TikToker user asked, to which Mrsbelleblake responded, "No, he isn't." This is a good thing as she alleged that her ex-husband was abusive.</p><p>Her post has also comforted other women in similar situations. "THANK YOU!!!!! I am currently in a situation where I can't post anything publicly," a comment on the video reads. I have to suffer in silence … I'll have my day. It's not today, but my story is still my story!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqKVdmbK1rcilqmadppq%2FunnPmqmepqSoeq%2B1xqGrppmimnq4tdOhZKyslaW6sLmMp6Zmmp%2Bqu6Wt0aKcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./us-ending-explained-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lets Talk About the Ending of Jordan Peeles Us</span></a>
