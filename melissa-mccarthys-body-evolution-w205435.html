But you go through everything, like maybe if I was taller, prettier, thinner, would I be going out on more auditions? But then in the back of my head, I didn’t want to do those parts.”</p><p>After getting her start with the Groundlings improv comedy group — which also boasts <a href=#><strong>Kristen Wiig</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></a> as alums — McCarthy landed the role of Sookie St. James on <a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a> in 2000. Though fans loved <a href=#>her portrayal of the klutzy chef</a>, her true breakout moment didn’t arrive for another decade.</p><p>In September 2010, the Identity Thief star debuted as one half of the titular couple in the sitcom Mike & Molly. She won an Emmy the following year for her performance in the show’s first season, but it was her turn in <a href=#>Bridesmaids</a> that catapulted her to a totally different level of fame. The part garnered her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 2012 Oscars — a rarity for a comedy role.</p><p>Though her stock was soaring, the comedian still faced criticism about her weight and often fielded questions about it in interviews.</p><p>“I just find it dumb and boring. I really do,” she told <a href=#>AARP The Magazine</a> in April 2018. “No one’s asking a man, how do you keep your legs in shape? Which I’ve been asked. I think every time we categorize people — by weight, by race, by gender — we put them in boxes and it’s not a good thing for the world.”</p><p>For her part, the Nine Perfect Strangers alum just wants to <a href=#>set a good example for daughters</a> Vivian (born in May 2007) and Georgette (born in February 2010), whom she shares with husband <a href=#><strong>Ben Falcone</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There’s an epidemic in our country of girls and women feeling bad about themselves based on what 0.5 percent of the human race looks like,” she told <a href=#>Redbook</a> in March 2016. “It starts very young. My message is that as long as everybody’s healthy, enjoy and embrace whatever body type you have.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at McCarthy’s body evolution over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkuqa4yKyqmmWdmLCivtOhsKxlkqSxunnEr6alraSevK951mtnbmxjanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-lady-gaga-1011.html><span>←</span><span>Lady Gaga Fashion Interview - Real Lady Gaga Quotes on Style</span></a>
