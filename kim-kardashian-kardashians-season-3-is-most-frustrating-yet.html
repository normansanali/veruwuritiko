We’re always family … but I’m also proud that <a href=#>everyone’s really vulnerable</a> because I’m sure so many other families have gone through similar things.”</p><p>Fans got their <a href=#>first official glimpse of season 3</a> in April with a heated trailer that showed Kim and the Poosh founder facing one of their biggest arguments yet. As Kim prepared for <a href=#>her Dolce & Gabbana spring/summer 2023 show appearance</a> during Milan Fashion Week, her older sister voiced her strong — and not-so-positive — opinions on the collab.</p><p>“My sister used my wedding as a business opportunity,” Kourtney claimed.</p><p>Viewers previously saw Kourtney and <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> working with the same fashion label <a href=#>ahead of their May 2022 nuptials in Italy</a> during season 2 of the reality series. The sibling drama seemed to reach a breaking point in last month’s teaser.</p><p>“I’m really confused how this narrative came into her head,” Kim argued, noting that she was “mindful” about <a href=#>Kourtney’s established relationship</a> with the brand before her runway appearance.</p><p>Hulu dropped a closer look at the new episodes on Monday, May 15. “I don’t want to fight with family — bottom line,” Kim says in a voiceover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kim-Kardashian-Says-New-Kardashians-Season-Was-Frustrating-Internally-With-Family-Amid-Kourtney-Kardashian-Tension2.jpg><p>Kourtney, for her part, calls out the lack of “boundaries” and “respect” as <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> asks, “How did we get here?”</p><p>While discussing the fallout from <a href=#>her and Kourtney’s feud</a>, the aspiring lawyer opened up about <a href=#>how the dynamics change</a> when the cameras go down. “There’s different cycles,” she explained on Tuesday. “You film it and then months later — we think we’re good and we make up — and then you edit it and I’m seeing all the things she said about me behind my back and she’s seeing [the same] and <a href=#>tension rises all over again</a>.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder joked that the filming process is like “therapy” for her. “It gets really tricky and it gets really emotional,” she added. “But at the end of the day, we still love sharing our life and I don’t see that changing any time soon.”</p><p>Kim wasn’t the only sister to promote the new season on Tuesday. Khloé, 38, <a href=#>appeared virtually on Good Morning America</a> to share a sneak peek with fans. In the clip, she sits down with Kourtney to discuss how the family works through their biggest challenges.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re all so good at lifting each other up when we’re in a crisis, but in, like, almost a superficial way,” Kourtney claims. “I don’t think we know how to be there for each other on, like, a deeper level.”</p><p>The Kardashians season 3 premieres on Hulu Thursday, May 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYriivsOaqqGhkaPAbr%2FEmqqopl1oeqq%2FjKamrKxdm7%2B2v9OrmK2hnpx6urHTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./409110-katie-douglas-boyfriend-the-actress-html.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Douglas' Boyfriend: The Actress Keeps Her Love Life Private &amp;amp; Has Several Male Friends</span></a>
