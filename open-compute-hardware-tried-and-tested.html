More importantly though, we were already familiar with the 'chocolate', in that by reading the specifications and following OCP related news, most of the systems present in their labs we could point out and name.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9138/P9114165_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Wannes, Johan, and&nbsp;Matt&nbsp;Corddry, director of hardware of engineering in the Facebook Hardware labs</p><p>This symbolizes one of the ultimate goals for the Open Compute project: complete standardization of the datacenter out of commodity components that can be sourced from multiple vendors. And when the standards do not fit your exotic workload, you have a solid foundation to start from. This approach has some pleasant side effects: when working in an OCP powered datacenter, you could switch jobs to another OCP DC and just carry on doing sysadmin tasks -- you know the system, you have your tools. When migrating from a Dell to HP environment for example, the switch will be a larger hurdle due to differentiation by marketing.</p><p>Microsoft's Open Cloud Server v2 spec actually goes the extra mile by supplying you with an API specification and implementation in the Chassis controller, giving devops a REST API to manage the hardware.</p><h2>Intel Decathlete v2, AMD Open 3.0, and Microsoft OCS</h2><p>Facebook is not the only vendor to contribute open server hardware to open compute project either; Intel and AMD joined pretty soon after the OCP was founded, and last year Microsoft <a href=#>joined the party</a> as well in a big way. The Intel Decathlete is currently in its <a href=#>second incarnation</a> with Haswell support. Intel uses its Decathlete motherboards, which are compatible with ORv1, to build its reference <a href=#>1U/2U 19" server</a> implementations. These systems are seen in critical environments, like High Frequency Trading systems, where the customers want a server built by the same people who built the CPU and chipset, just so it all ought to work well together.</p><p>AMD has its <a href=#>Open 3.0 platform</a>, which we <a href=#>detailed</a> in 2013. This server platform is AMD's way of getting its foot in the door of OCP hyperscale datacenters, certainly when considering price. AMD seems to be taking a bit of a break improving its regular Opteron x86 CPUs, and we wonder if we might see the company bring its <a href=#>AMD Opteron-A ARM64 platform</a> (dubbed 'Seattle') into the fold.</p><p>Microsoft brought us its Open Cloud Server (v2), systems that basically power all of Microsoft's cloud services (e.g. Azure), which is a high-density blade-like solution for standard 19" racks.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9138/OCS-chassis_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>(Image Courtesy Microsoft)</p><p>A 12U chassis, equipped with 6 large 140x140mm fans, 6 power supplies, and a chassis manager module carries 24 nodes. Similar to Facebook's servers, there are two node types: one for compute, one for storage. A major difference however is that the chassis provides network connectivity at the back using a 40 QSFP+ port and a 10 SFP+ port for each node. The compute nodes mate with the connectors inside the chassis, the actual network cabling can remain fixed. The same principle is applied to the storage nodes, where the actual SAS connectors are found on the chassis, eliminating the need for cabling runs to connect the compute and JBOD nodes.</p><p>A V2 compute node comes with up two Intel Haswell CPUs, with a 120 Watt maximum thermal allowance, paired to the C610 chipset and with 16 DIMM DDR4 slots to share, for a total memory capacity of 512GB. Storage can be provided through one of the 10 SATA ports or via NVMe flash storage. The enclosure provides space for four 3.5" hard disks, four 2.5" SSDs (though space is shared between two of the bottom SSD slots), and a NVMe card. A mezzanine header allows you to plug in a network controller or a SAS controller card. Management of the node can be done through the AST1050 BMC providing standard IPMI functionality, in addition a serial console of each node is available at the chassis manager as well.</p><p>The storage node is a JBOD in which then 3.5" SATA III hard disks can be placed, all connected to a SAS expander board. The expander board then connects to the SAS connectors on the tray backplane, where they can be linked to a compute node.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZyf5dopqmdnmKwsLnPrqueZZiWv6XDwKucZqyinrKlecCnm2aslajBprCOcg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savithri-balasubrahmanyam.html><span>←</span><span>Savithri Balasubrahmanyam - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</span></a>
