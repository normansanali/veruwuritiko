Eva Mendes spent some mommy-and-me time with Esmeralda, her oldest daughter with Ryan Gosling, in New York yesterday. The actress was spotted carrying the three-year-old, who looked too cute in a pair of tiny pigtails and a blue-and-white polka-dot dress, around the city. The mother of two wore a heart-patterned Saint Laurent shirt, tortoiseshell sunglasses, and a blue cross-body bag. Gosling and their one-year-old daughter, Amada, weren't present, but it was a sweet mother-daughter outing nonetheless."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The stars don't bring their girls to public events and are rarely photographed with them. They even take the same low-key approach with their own relationship, as they hardly make any red carpet appearances together.</p><img alt='pstrong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor"/strongstrong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor"Where they met: /strongSorry, ladies.

Gosling, for example, raved about Mendes' parenting skills and in his cover story for GQ in December 2016. "Eva's the dream mother, and they're dream babies, and it's like a dream that I'm having right now. I'm dreaming it all," he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More recently, Mendes <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a12436104/eva-mendes-ryan-goslings-daughters-bilingual/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=revealed class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">revealed</a> that their daughters are growing up bilingual.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Esmeralda mostly speaks Spanglish right now," she told <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/chica/eva-mendes-talks-returning-cuba-raising-daughters-as-latinas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. "It's really cute. She's definitely bilingual, and it's really important for us to make sure that she's not only just familiar with the language, but also with the culture. My mom, who lives 15 minutes away, makes it easy because she speaks to the girls in Spanish and cooks them Cuban food. And we're always listening to Cuban music. It really is a big part of our way of life.
