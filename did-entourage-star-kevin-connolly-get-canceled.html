[It was] Saturday and then the show aired on Sunday night, and on Monday my life had changed completely,” Connolly explained. “I don’t know that I would call it my ‘I made it moment’ but it is something I will never forget because it was hard to wrap my head around it.''</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Entourage: Everything The Cast Has Been Up To Since The Finale</a></span></p><p>“I had bounced around for so long and had been doing this for 20 years by then. I would then walk to my coffee place that I had been going to for 100 years, and heads would be turning when I walked in, it was strange. I lived in an apartment building and had to move out of my apartment building because people would be knocking at my door.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did the show last eight seasons, but it also had a film released as well.

The workload has slowed down on-camera, due to certain allegations that we'll cover a little later.</p><p>However, <a href=#>he did some work as a director on the film 'Dear Eleanor'</a>.

The accusations came from Gracie Cox, a former assistant costume designer. According to the designer, Connolly forced himself onto her during a party. She issued a lengthy statement.</p><p><a href=#>Connolly's team responded to the accusations</a>, stating that the incident to take place in the early 2000s was a consensual one, ''Kevin strongly supports victims of sexual assault and believes their claims should always be heard. As someone who has worked in this industry for four decades, he has treated people with nothing but respect and has maintained a stellar reputation. Therefore, he was completely shocked to learn of the allegations made by Gracie Cox from a wrap party in 2005."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if that story wasn't tough enough to digest for the 'Entourage' star, TMZ ran a story on him in March, detailing his tantrum after his Tesla got towed out in LA outside of a flower shop.</p><p>The spots are reserved for the clients and it is said that Kevin parked there on the regular for his podcast.
