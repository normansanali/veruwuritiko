Chris Pratt has revealed that he was spurred into making dramatic lifestyle changes after being turned down for a movie role.
The actor says he took drastic measures and lost over 35 kgs after missing out on the role of Scott Hatteberg in the movie, Moneyball because he was 'too fat' says The Sun.
Refusing to take no for an answer Pratt set about transforming himself and was determined to shed the kilos at the gym as quickly as possible in order to get the part."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
