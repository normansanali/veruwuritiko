The concept of Johnson’s murder-mystery plot was first created back in 2019 with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knives Out</a></strong>, which centered around a mysterious and major death in a wealthy, dysfunctional family.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Each film has been highlighted by a star-studded lineup of A-List celebrities — including the likes of Daniel Craig, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Evans</a>, Dave Bautista, Edward Norton, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle Monáe</a>.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>And, while the popularity surrounding Johnson’s brainchild has seemingly never dwindled, some fans may be asking themselves just how many movies fall under this specific murder-mystery umbrella. So, before you power up Netflix and load up Glass Onion,&nbsp;let’s examine how many movies fit within Johnson’s whodunit catalog.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-knives-out-movies-are-there data-injectable=false>How many Knives Out movies are there?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image_2022-11-22_053403440.png><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>As of now, there are 2 movies in Johnson’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knives Out</a> franchise. As previously mentioned, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knives Out</a> (2019) kickstarted the narrative, with the film’s ensemble cast presenting an out-of-this-world extravaganza that tied together secrets, betrayal, family, and loyalty. All was eventually settled in the end, when the puzzle was ultimately solved, although the thrilling events within the project only prompted fans to desire more mysteries from Johnson.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Next up was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glass Onion</a>: A Knives Out Mystery, which follows a similar premise and memorably brings back Daniel Craig as intuitive detective Benoit Blanc. The critically acclaimed sequel, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, features Blanc taking on a brand-new case. He must rely on clues, minuscule hints, and other elements to figure out a seemingly unsolvable mystery. Both films have become heavily favored amongst moviegoers, prompting all signs to point toward a possible third outing.</p><h2 id=h-will-there-be-a-knives-out-3 data-injectable=false>Will there be a Knives Out 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Glass-Onion-Boarding-a-boat.jpg><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>For those interested in the intriguing narrative, you’re in luck. A third movie is currently in development! While we don’t have many details, yet, about its plot or release, we do know that the movie may take a detour from the previous two.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Variety</a>, Johnson said “I’m starting to work on the third movie now, and that’s also what’s got me creatively jazzed: I don’t have to replicate the last movie at all. The goal is to strike out in a completely new direction tonally and thematically.”</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>No matter what direction Johnson chooses to go, we’re confident that this third addition will continue the strong legacy of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knives Out</a> series.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>For now, catch Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, which is available to stream now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaKur8WMpKWirpWoerDB02akqK6ZmsBurdGeZK2glaeycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-mccormack.html><span>←</span><span>Eric McCormack</span></a>
