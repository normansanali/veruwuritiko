The company plans to start volume production using the technology in the second half of 2019.</span></p><p>Samsung says that its 3rd Generation 10 nm-class manufacturing technology (also known as 1z-nm) for DRAM enables it to make 20% more 8 Gb DDR4 memory chips per wafer than the 2nd Gen 10-nm class (aka 1y-nm) does. An increase of the number of dies per wafer essentially means that the new 8 Gb DDR4 device is approximately 20% smaller* than the previous-gen 8 Gb DRAM, which means a tangible decrease of production costs at the same yield and at the same cycle time. This should mean cheaper DRAM pricies for consumers.</p><p>Samsung traditionally does not disclose exact smallest half-pitch size of the new memory device, so at this time we do not have any information about the new chip’s geometries. Since we are dealing with a 1z node, it is reasonable to assume that the smallest half-pitch size is well below 15 nm, but this is speculation.</p><p>The world’s largest maker of memory is especially proud that its 3rd Generation 10 nm-class manufacturing technology for DRAM continues to use ArF (argon fluoride) immersion lithography tools and does not require EUVL. Keeping in mind that ultra-thin nodes require multi-patterning in case of immersion lithography, it is logical to assume that Samsung uses this method along with various tricks to ensure good yields and performance.</p><p>Samsung will start production of 8 Gb DDR4 memory chips using its 1z-nm fabrication process in the second half of the year. The first products based on the 8 Gb 1z chips will be DDR4 DRAM modules. Once they are validated by CPU designers, they will be used for PCs in 2020.</p><p>Going forward, the same manufacturing technology will be used to produce DRAMs with “higher capacities and performance”.</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p>Source: <a href=#>Samsung</a></p><p>*Note: This is a very rough calculation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51fZBxZqyZnajCr7OMnZyvnZykvbR5l2aem2WUp66uv4yuqqKml2KAs7CMoJynZWFlu66vy5qqrGWgp7yksdKsZK2dk527sLjOoLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-and-michael-now-prison-brides.html><span>←</span><span>Prison Brides: Michael and Erin Update</span></a>
