You'll need to keep your wits about you and approach each encounter in the original Kingdom Hearts' Hades Cup with caution.<h2>How do you beat the cloud in the Coliseum?</h2>Focus on defeating Cloud first, as his thrusting attacks are the most dangerous attacks in this fight. Leon will spend most of his time passing back and forth, and when he finally does attack, he using a jumping attack that 4 out of 5 times will be evaded when trying to evade Cloud.<h2>How do you open the chest in the Coliseum in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>Obtained: This Keychain can be found inside the chest in the lobby area of the Olympus Coliseum. This chest can only be opened once the player has completed Phil Cup, Pegasus Cup, and Hades Cup.<h2>Is Olympus Coliseum optional?</h2>While the Colosseum is a completely optional world, it's quite a useful one for the prizes. *Metal Chocobo, Olympia, and LionHeart are all powerful Keyblades that are acquired from clearing the Pegasus, Hurcules and Hades cups.<h2>Ⓜ Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Final Mix ▸ 100% Proud Walkthrough #5: Olympus Coliseum</h2><p></p><h2>Do you have to beat the Coliseum in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>This is a very difficult battle, but the nice part is, you don't necessarily have to win. If you're in it to win it, stay on the move and attack with fire from a distance.<h2>What worlds can I skip in KH1?</h2>In KH1, the worlds that I definitely know are skippable are either Atlantica or Halloween Town (as in, it's compulsory to play at least one of them in order to unlock Neverland).<h2>Is there a keyhole in Olympus Coliseum?</h2>The Keyhole of Olympus Coliseum is hidden in the Lobby, underneath a large stone block.<h2>Where do I get the Lionheart Keyblade?</h2>"Raises max MP by 1, and enhances magic and summon power. Also deals great physical damage." Obtained: This Keychain will be rewarded to Sora after defeating Leon and Cloud in the Hades Cup.<h2>How do you get the Chest in Wonderland in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>Hit the latch next to the Teddy Bear so that it drops into the chair. Now exit the Bizarre Room and climb up the mushrooms near the entrance of the Lotus Forest and reach the corner exit to return to the Bizarre Room. Turn the faucet to animate the pot then jump into it to reach a chest with a Meteor- G inside.<h2>What level should I be to beat Cloud in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>It is one of the most difficult bossfights in the game, with a recommended level of over 60.<h2>What do you get for beating Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts 1?</h2>It will take all of Sora's strength and abilities to take him out, but the rewards are worth it as he holds the powerful One-Winged Angel Keyblade. Sephiroth also has Ansem's Report 12, which is good to get for anyone who's a completionist of the game.<h2>How long does the Hades Cup take?</h2>Due to the cup's length the time trial lasts twenty minutes, although both it and the solo challenges likely cannot be attempted haphazardly, especially on Proud difficulty. After the Hades Cup the Gold Match also becomes available.<h2>How do you hurt Hades?</h2>You can also hit Hades with Blizzaga, since it will extinguish the flames and deal him some damage, giving you the opportunity to attack him. It is nearly impossible to go to Hades' back and attack him because Hades will almost always face Sora.<h2>How do you get Hercules Cup in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>Pegasus Cup: Defeat Parasite Cage for the second time in Monstro. Hercules Cup: Seal the Keyholes in Halloween Town and Neverland. Hades Cup: Unlock the three tournaments above and seal the Hollow Bastion Keyhole. In this Cup, your progress will be stored every 10 rounds, even if you lose.<h2>What's the strongest Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts?</h2>Undoubtedly, Ultima Weapon is the most powerful Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Remix Keyblade. Ultima Weapon has a whopping 14 Attack and gives bonuses of +9 to Strength and +2 MP. In all stats categories, Ultima Weapon bests or at least ties Kingdom Hearts' other Keyblades.<h2>What is the strongest Keyblade?</h2>1 Ultima Weapon<p>With a name like "Ultima Weapon", this Keyblade was bound to be the most powerful in the game. Not only does it have the highest Strength stat at +12, but it also has incredible reach and speed.</p><h2>What is the best Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts?</h2><p>Kingdom Hearts: Best Keyblades And How To Get Them</p><ul><li>8 Lady Luck.</li><li>7 Spellbinder.</li><li>6 Diamond Dust.</li><li>5 Olympia.</li><li>4 Lionheart.</li><li>3 One Winged Angel.</li><li>2 Ultima Weapon.</li><li>1 Divine Rose.</li></ul><h2>What happens when Sora seals a keyhole?</h2>Sora sealed the Keyhole and then followed Ansem to the End of the World, a place formed from the remains of worlds taken by the Heartless. Deep in the darkness of that place lay the Door to Darkness, with Kingdom Hearts lying beyond it.<h2>How do you get the one winged angel Keyblade?</h2>Obtained: The player must win the Platinum Match at the Olympus Coliseum. The Platinum Match is unlocked after sealing the Keyhole at Hallow Bastion.<h2>What do I do after the Olympus Coliseum?</h2>After locking Wonderland and Deep Jungle (Olympus Coliseum isn't necessary), go back to Traverse Town before moving on to the next world. Start off by going to the alleyway in the second district.<h2>What level should Sora be at the end of the world?</h2>Talking numbers just for a moment, it's best to hit End of the World around Level 50, or just a bit more. If the party needs some toughening up, go fight in Traverse Town or the Coliseum, where the Hades Cup is now underway.<h2>What is the best Kingdom Hearts world?</h2><p>10 Best Kingdom Hearts Worlds That Capture the Magic of the...</p><ul><li>The World That Never Was (Kingdom Hearts 2) ...</li><li>Traverse Town (Kingdom Hearts) ...</li><li>Hollow Bastion/Radiant Gardens (Kingdom Hearts) ...</li><li>Symphony of Sorcery (Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance) ...</li><li>Timeless River (Kingdom Hearts 2) ...</li><li>Halloween Town (Kingdom Hearts)</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormacn2LGsMGMm5yarF2ptaZ5zqWwpqilqHqku8uiqp6tnWK2r3nKoqWgnJ%2BieqmxwKurrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golden-bachelors-gerry-turner-and-theresa-nist-are-getting-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Golden Bachelor's Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist Are Getting Divorce</span></a>
