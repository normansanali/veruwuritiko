Think Mr. And Mrs. Smith, except only the wife is an assassin, and the husband is nothing but urban camouflage (aka cover). Writer/Director&nbsp;<span>Zack Whedon never loses the reality that his graphic-designing hero is in completely over his head, and makes a better thriller for it. It’s still very monotone and a bit predictable, but Whedon stays true to the foolish things love makes us do, from challenging mercenaries to investigating government conspiracies – even when you aren’t Jason Bourne.</span></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false><span>Aaron Paul&nbsp;stars as David, a boyfriend who wakes up one morning to find his girlfriend Claire (Annabelle Wallis) missing. No note, no fight the night before, no suspected&nbsp;cheating – just an empty bed and no answers. David does his best to involve police, but after a year with no answers, hope begins to dim.</span></p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true><span>That’s when David gets a visit from one of Claire’s college friends, who ends up cold-clocking the still grieving boyfriend. David comes to, with the realization that&nbsp;more intricate&nbsp;schemes are at play. A roll of film retrieved from his garden leads David on a wild goose chase filled with back-door shadiness, drawing&nbsp;closer to the women he fell in love with. Whoever she is, she better be worth the life her jilted lover is&nbsp;willing to sacrifice.</span></p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>David’s constant need to get his ass kicked becomes the most redeeming quality of Come And Find Me, simply from a logistical standpoint. Not in a masochistic way – like I’m harboring some secret vendetta against Aaron Paul – but because David always seems&nbsp;overmatched (and he should).</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>First he wanders into a Russian gangster meeting with no plan, then he gets disarmed in a matter of seconds by Garret Dillahunt’s agent&nbsp;– you get the picture. David doesn’t posses a particular set of skills, or any secret military training. He’s a desk-tethered computer guy who sticks his nose where it shouldn’t belong, all in the name of scream-it-from-the-mountain-tops&nbsp;love. It’s these homely charms that&nbsp;Whedon agreeably exploits, both as an underdog heroism arc and a source of tense entertainment.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>That said, Come And Find Me isn’t exactly the most daring thriller around. You’ve all seen this Aaron Paul before. Pouty, always looks like his face is glued with a confused expression on his face.&nbsp;<span>Annabelle Wallis brings life to Paul’s character whenever she’s present, which means he’s only wandering around emotionless for half the movie, turning over rocks and taking electric shocks to the&nbsp;body.</span></p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false><span>I rather like Wallis as a maybe-secret-agent/maybe-bubbly-artist – especially come David’s darkest moments – but&nbsp;Whedon meanders during his lengthy two-hour-ish run time. Over and over, David&nbsp;pieces together a puzzle that becomes obvious to a fault, yet&nbsp;Whedon still plays dumb for about twenty minutes too long.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-characters=824 data-current-count=1160 data-injectable=true>In order to combat a feeling of drawn-out investigating,&nbsp;Whedon gets crafty by cutting between David’s current mission and sunny memories of his dearest Claire. One minute David can be laying in a pool of his own blood, the next he’s laying next to Claire, blissfully unaware of the adventure future-David will embark on. This allows for more emotional connectivity&nbsp;than some blurry flashbacks like in most generic thrillers, where David might&nbsp;gaze into the distance, cuing wavy lines that reach back in time. We’re instead guided through David’s memories, as he begins&nbsp;realizing some of Claire’s&nbsp;glaring slip-ups&nbsp;during their romantic relationship. Real-time cerebral recognition versus rigid flashbacks – a small decision that brings something just different enough into the fray.</p><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>In the basest sense,&nbsp;Zack Whedon’s feature debut displays a coherent ability to connect story, tension and performances in appealing fashion. That might sound like a backhanded compliment, but you couldn’t be more wrong.&nbsp;<strong>Come And Find Me&nbsp;</strong>is a fine-and-dandy missing persons thriller with a romantic twist, suitable for those whose Aaron Paul senses tingle upon reading the film’s synopsis. First-time features are anything but safe bets, so a cheers is in order for Whedon’s accomplishment – no matter how small.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fair</h5><p class=review-summary>Come And Find Me is a weird blend of Mr. And Mrs. Smith and Charlie Countryman that somehow works.</p><p class=review-title>Come And Find Me Review</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqillWKur7CMn6CnnF2ism6%2BxK%2Bgnq9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wiu-offers-in-person-counseling-for-students.html><span>←</span><span>WIU offers in-person counseling for students</span></a>
