I fill up notebooks and file folders with research notes before every trip. I want to know our options so we don’t spend time researching once we get there and it allows for opportunities of spontaneity and living in the moment.</p><p>I receive messages constantly from friends and readers asking for the best places to eat while traveling. I have been to NYC so many times that I want to share my own New York City Travel Guide. This guide will include the best places to eat and see along the way. Many of you have used my&nbsp;<strong><span><a href=#>California Pacific Coast Highway Guide</a></span></strong>&nbsp;and now it’s time for the East Coast!</p><p>Also, my brother, Jeff, and his wife, Christeena lived for 14+ years in the heart of Manhattan, a few blocks from Times Square (and still have a place there).

Go to Whole Foods at Columbus Circle, pick up a picnic lunch, and head over to the Great Lawn or Sheep’s Meadow area for a picnic. There are some must hit places such as Belverde Castle (for amazing views), the Boat Pond, Bethesda Fountain, The Mall area for tree-lined photos, the Pond, Central Park Zoo, the Carousel, the Lake, and riding bikes along the perimeter. If you really want to splurge, take a horse-drawn carriage ride around the park. If you want the quintessential New York experience, eat at the Loeb Boathouse or Tavern on the Greens.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2873-copy.jpg alt="Best Places to Eat and See in New York City.

It is a 2 lane bikeway with only pedestrian and bicycle traffic so you can get places quickly without dealing with taxi cabs trying to run you over. There are many places that are tree-lined and lush so it’s a refreshing getaway from the hustle and bustle within the city walls. We usually ride from Central Park all the way down to Battery Park near the Statue of Liberty.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0689-copy.jpg alt="Best Places to Eat and See in New York City.

I learned this tip from a few locals, tried it myself and it worked like a charm. Believe it or not, the price listed is only a suggested price. We were pressed for time and were only going to be in the museums for a short time so we just gave a donation. You can donate anything you would like from $1 – $ 20 or whatever you would like. We tried it with success at the MET and the Natural History museums so give it a shot.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2925-copy.jpg alt="Best Places to Eat and See in New York City.

The museum costs money but is very educational and quite heartbreaking. The movies shown are powerful. The outdoor Memorials have beautiful water features with the names of those who passed away engraved in stone. One World Observatory is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. They offer an incredible elevator ride up to the top that goes beyond just the amazing views.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0584-copy.jpg alt="Best Places to Eat and See in New York City.

It’s less congested and an easier commute into the city. The bus is an inexpensive option and takes you straight to the Port Authority near Times Square.</li><li>Everyone seems to want to stay near Times Square because that is the heart of NYC; however the hotels are generally more expensive, good food options limited, and it is very crowded. Research other areas near Central Park or the Chelsea area for a less congested stay and better restaurant options.</li><li>If you want to add Boston to your trip, you can take the BOLT Bus from NYC to Boston for such an inexpensive price. For the 4 of us, it cost $10 each. The buses were clean, spacious, and had free Wi-Fi and even outlets to charge your phone. We flew into Newark airport and departed from Boston.</li><li>Check into New York City Passes if you want to experience a lot of New York for a discounted price.</li><li>Check Groupon and TravelZoo for ticket and entertainment options.</li><li>Hotwire offers many NYC hotels at discounts. Do your research and it can save you a lot of money in the long run.</li><li>Biking the city is so much fun and a great way to take in city life. You can ride right along with the taxi cabs or take the Hudson River trail or Brooklyn Bridge.</li><p>I am going to now take a long winter’s nap because wow that was a long post! I hope that it helps you make your next trip to New York City a memorable experience. Pin your favorite images on Pinterest to reference later.
