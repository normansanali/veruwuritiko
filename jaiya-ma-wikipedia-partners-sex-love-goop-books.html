What about her partners?</p><p>All the queries will be addressed in this Jaiya Ma Wikipedia.</p><h3><strong>Jaiya Ma On S*x Love & Goop</strong></h3><p>Jaiya Ma, a s*xologist has joined Netflix’s new show S*x, Love & Scoop. The show returned for a new season led by actress Gwyneth Paltrow. It featured six couples who would open up about all things in the bedroom in front of the experts. Also, the show demonstrates how the actress’s wellness & lifestyle brand Goop works to gain more pleasure with their other half.</p><p>She joins Gwyneth Paltrow, Michaela – relationship expert, <a href=#>Darshana Avila</a> – Erotic Wholeness Coach, and Amina – intimacy coach for the show. But, this isn’t the first time she appeared for a TV show as she appeared in Ricki Lake, The Doctors, Good Morning America, Nightline, The Anderson Show, The Tyra Banks Show, TLC, CNN, or Playboy TV to mention a few.</p><h3><strong>Jaiya Ma Books</strong></h3><p>Jaiya Ma has published four books to date.

After being in a relationship for six years, her boyfriend Jon Hanauer urged her to take a new lover. Jaiya and Jon had met in June 2000 while taking tantric yoga classes in Cinncinati, Ohio, and fell in love in March 2001 during a tantric teacher training course. Jon hailed from Boulder, Colorado, and studied at the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human S*xuality.</p><p>Within weeks, she met and fell for furniture designer Ian Ferguson after meeting him at a dance class, and a year later she fell pregnant with his baby. Ian worked as a president and lead designer at Dig It Furniture, Inc. He had studied theatre at NYU.

I have two amazing men who care for me and Eamon. Having three parents around just makes life even better, and everyone talks about how advanced Eamon is.”</p><p>Before that, Jaiya was engaged to a man named Tony who couldn’t fathom sharing his fiance despite discussing having an open relationship.

But, the assumption is yet to be confirmed.</p><p>On the other hand, Ian had gone through a divorce and had started dating other women and had discovered polyamorous relationships just two weeks before.</p><p>According to Jaiya’s Facebook, she is interested in both men and women, so she is bisexual, gender-wise.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Jaiya Ma?</strong></h3><p>If she had already celebrated her birthday in 2021, Jaiya Ma is 44 years old.
