His prosperous business career allowed him to accumulate this tremendous wealth.</p><p>He established a number of companies, such as a manufacturer of acetylene lamps and a ferry boat firm.

He later worked as a butcher. His mother was severe and a devoted Christian. When Sander was five years old, his father passed away, and his mother was made to work in a tomato cannery. When he was ten years old, he started working as a farmhand. Three years later, Sanders left his house and started working at odd jobs.</p><h2>What are the age, height, and weight of Colonel Sanders?</h2><p>Colonel Sanders passed away on September 9, 1990, at the age of 90. He weighed 85 kg and was 1.78 m tall.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>At an early age, Colonel Sanders worked a variety of odd jobs to start his career. In 1906, he secured employment as a conductor in New Albany, Indiana. He also spent a brief period of time in Cuba working as a wagoner for the US Army. By the age of 16, he was employed as a railway ash pan cleaner, a fireman, and a blacksmith.</p><p>He started working for the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1910, where he first met his wife. Later, he and his mother moved back to Henryville, where he worked as a worker, an insurance agent, and a salesman. In 1920, Sanders founded a ferry boat business, which was an immediate success. He was also given a job as a secretary at the Columbus Chamber of Commerce in Indiana at the same time.</p><p>Sanders made $22,000 selling his ferry business before starting a new acetylene light manufacturing business. In 1930, Shell Oil Company made him an offer for a service station in Kentucky. Sanders started selling a variety of foods, including chicken. Later, his standing rose to the point where then-governor Ruby Laffon named him a Kentucky colonel.</p><h3></h3><p>In 1952, Sanders revealed his top-secret “Kentucky Fried Chicken” recipe to some of the biggest eateries in the area. In the first year, sales of fried chicken more than tripled. Later, the idea was franchised by several other restaurant owners, who compensated him fairly for the formula.</p><p>In 1959, Sanders and his wife inaugurated the eatery and corporate headquarters in Shelbyville. With locations in Canada, Jamaica, the UK, and Mexico, KFC was one of the first food businesses to go global within a short period of time. In 1962, he was granted a patent for his recipe, and the following year, he registered the tagline “It’s Finger-Lickin’ Good” as a trademark.</p><p><a href=#>Also View Peter Mallouk’s Net worth, Bio, Career, and More.</a></p><h2>Achievements and Awards</h2><p>The Horatio Alger Award was given to Colonel Sanders in 1965.
