I remember saying no [at first, but] I thought about it and here we are, five years later. We’ve done the U.K, “Saturday Night Live” and all these different things. It’s a crazy thing to wrap your head around when you are responsible for getting the queen of drag into drag.”</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=false>Since getting the role, David Petruschin has received loads of praise and acclaim for their makeup work.
