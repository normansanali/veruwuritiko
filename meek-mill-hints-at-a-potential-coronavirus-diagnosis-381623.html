Negative tests for strep and the flu. They told me it was bronchitis but my symptoms pointed to the flu. Had a fever 103 for a few days, coughing, fatigue aches and pains They weren’t telling us then it was rona.’</p><p>One other follower posted this: ‘I went through the same thing in February after a trip to Cancun and tested negative for the FLU and Strep.
