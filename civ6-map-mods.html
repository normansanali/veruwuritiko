But it’s a normal thing to feel after spending so many hours going at them (if you’re like me, you know what I’m talking about).</p><p>In any case, we can all be grateful that there’s an easy solution. Custom maps!</p><p>The modding community has made dozens of these for all of us. The only question left is where to get started? Keep scrolling and see what kind of adventures you can find.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>15.</span> Perfectly Balanced</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/15-perfectly-balanced-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>If you’re one of those competitive players that wants an equal playing field for everyone, then you’re going to want to take a look at this bad boy.</p><p>This Perfectly Balanced Map allows you to have a <strong>truly</strong> competitive Civ 6 by providing a balanced map for six players to compete on.</p><p>The map has the same resources in every player’s starting location, so the outcome of the game will truly be decided by skill, rather than by starting position.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>14.</span> Sven’s Europe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/14-svens-europe-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Playing on Europe is challenging as a whole. And the game does allow you to do it without downloading any mods.</p><p>But do we really settle for a Europe that’s as small as the one in the base game? Of course we don’t.</p><p>PC games don’t know the word settling.</p><p>Sven’s Europe truly brings the best of Europe into the game by incorporating a <strong>massive</strong> representation of Europe as a playable map. Trust me – this one doesn’t disappoint. Give it a go and you’ll see what I’m talking about.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>13.</span> The Great Asia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/13-the-great-asia-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Have you been looking for an extremely detailed map of Asia, but nothing that the game comes with seems to suit your needs?</p><p>Well, this one is as detailed as can be.</p><p>From the most strategic resources to basic items and luxury resources, all located exactly where you expect them to be, this one has you covered.</p><p>You might want to take a look at the places where <a href=#>natural wonders</a> spawn, though!</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>12.</span> Tamriel – Ultimate Version</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/12-tamriel-ultimate-version-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>I mean, who of us wouldn’t just love to play in Tamriel and try to beat other civilizations in the space race?</p><p>I have to admit that I wasn’t expecting an Elder Scrolls mod for Civilization VI. But this is certainly one of those pleasant surprises.</p><p>This custom map is <strong>very well done</strong> and it truly transports you into the Elder Scrolls dimension.</p><p>It does raise the question of why other civilizations are all over the place when you were so used to seeing the Argonians in the Black Marsh and the Khajit in Elsweyr… but I’m sure you’ll be able to find mods for every Skyrim Civ if you keep searching.</p><p>As for getting started, this map is absolutely tailor-made for TES fans. A brilliant crossover.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>11.</span> Meteor Survival</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/11-meteor-survival-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Alright, picture this: a thousand years ago, a giant meteor hit the Earth.</p><p>Except this time, the planet didn’t heal as quickly as before, nor did the impact cause enough damage to extinguish humans as we know them.</p><p>This time, it will be on your hands to get down to business and start civilization anew. In a world that seems to have received a gigantic meteor impact in the middle of its mass… which is now turned into a giant ocean that you’ll be able to cross to conquer everything.</p><p>How cool is that?</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>10.</span> Historical Spawn Dates</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/10-historical-spawn-dates-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>This fantastic mod makes civilizations spawn according to the date when they <strong>actually</strong> became prevalent in our own world.</p><p>Which gives the game a newfound sense of realism that can be missing from the vanilla version, at the expense of sacrificing some of its balanced integrity.</p><p>The “Spawn by Era instead of Date” option will become available once you get this mod installed. Really, it’s an easy setup.</p><p>And it’s a good one to try if you’re looking for more unique spawning.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>9.</span> Azimuthal Map Script</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/09-azimuthal-map-script-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>So you’re here because you’ve tried many of these “Earth Map Mods” and you simply want to try something different.</p><p>If that’s the case, let me introduce you to the Azimuthal Map mod. This one’s based on the <a href=#>Azimuthal Map projection of Earth</a>.</p><p>In case you haven’t seen it, the map places the poles as “circles” around the actual map. A quick Google search and you’ll see what I mean.</p><p>But I say download this map and try it out just to see what you think. Trust me – you won’t regret it!</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>8.</span> Gaia Map Script</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/08-gaia-map-script-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>This unpredictable map script allows you to experience Earth in a much different way, where continents will spawn as if Earth had much more land than sea.</p><p>An interesting thought, right?</p><p>It’s a very well-made script that fully shakes up the way you’ll get the map if you went for the “Landmasses” choice in the vanilla game. It’s much better and very well-made.</p><p>Granted this isn’t literally a map itself, more of a script to redesign in-game maps. But it works all the same.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>7.</span> Fantastical Map Script</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/07-fantastical-map-script-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>“Vast jungles and icy lands” is the best way to describe this mod, according to creator of this script.</p><p>It basically ignores the actual laws of physics and Earth itself to create unique maps that make it far more entertaining.</p><p>It’s a great add-on that I fully recommend to anyone looking for a diverse and unique experience in Civ 6. Just note, this isn’t gonna run like a super realistic world.</p><p>We’re getting into some semi-fantasy territory with this one.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>6.</span> JT Warhammer Mod</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/06-jt-warhammer-mod-civilization-vi.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Okay, this one isn’t as much of a map mod as it is an <strong>entire game mod</strong>, but I’m adding it because we definitely get some big map changes.</p><p>This brings the world of Warhammer into Civ 6 by introducing new civilizations, a new map, and a bunch of cool Warhammer gadgets.</p><p>A must-try if you’re a fan of both franchises!</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>5.</span> Got Lakes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/05-got-lakes-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Now if you’re a fan of maps with lakes, you’re going to fall in love with this one. Probably.</p><p>It changes the spawn rules for lakes and turns your map into something out of a fantasy film, but without looking too out of place.</p><p>In fact, I’d say this is one of the most “realistic” map scripts out there, taking into consideration that it makes lakes the common denominator of all matches.</p><p>One of the things that I like the most about this mod is the fact that it <strong>doesn’t</strong> break the game balance. It keeps most settlers able to reach most landmasses without the need of any sails. Fair play.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>4.</span> Optimized World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/04-optimized-world-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>This is a beta map that I decided to add to my list. Why?</p><p>Because it makes the game <strong>much more fun to play</strong> and balances out the buggy Earth that comes with vanilla Civ 6.</p><p>It’s not as much of an Earth map really, but morso an optimization of the vanilla one.</p><p>And beta or no beta, it should be playable without many quirks.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>3.</span> Detailed Worlds</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/03-detailed-worlds-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>So you wanted realism? Well my friend, you’ve got it.</p><p>This mod changes the way the game’s random map generator works by making it much more in-tune with the real world. The goal is improving gameplay by better distributing the world’s features all over the map.</p><p>Try it out if you want to stick as close to our world as possible, but still want some kind of freshness.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>2.</span> TSL – Huge Earth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/02-tsl-huge-earth-civilization-vi-mod.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Let’s face it: if there’s one thing that the Steam Community has given us, it’s representations of Earth in the game.</p><p>And it’s safe to say that the game’s base Earth map is just too small. It was only a matter of time before someone made their own… but I didn’t want to include all of the Earth maps on my list. I mean there are so many out there, we’d basically have ONLY have Earth maps here.</p><p>So I picked the best Earth map that I found, and here we are. And it deserves such a good spot because we all know that playing on Earth is just one of the best things about a casual Civ match.</p><p>Get this one installed and be prepared to have your PC’s resources obliterated by its demands. Kidding, of course (kinda).</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>1.</span> Yet (not) Another Map’s Pack</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/11/10516/01-yet-not-another-maps-pack-civilization-vi.jpg><p class=centerme><a href=# class=visitcta>Check Out This Mod</a></p><p>Let’s be honest: unless you’re on a mod spree, downloading a bunch of mods separately can be a pain.</p><p>Let’s say you just want to dive straight into new world maps with a single download. Well in that case, snag this mod pack.</p><p>It comes with 9 amazing maps put together, all ones that I highly recommend. But maybe not in Enormous size if you don’t want your computer to implode on itself.</p><p>Still an absolute delight. And this is perfect even for newcomers to the series taking their first steps in modding the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63Nnaamq6CkwW%2BvzqZmnKGma3qurc9mpKico2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dell-xps-14z-lots-of-features-in-a-small-package.html><span>←</span><span>The Screen: A Crying Shame</span></a>
