A year later, when he was twelve years old, Morrison formed his first band, a skiffle group, "The Sputniks", named after the recently launched Soviet satellite, Sputnik 1. In 1958, the band played at some of the local cinemas, and Morrison took the lead, contributing most of the singing and arranging. Other short-lived groups followed – at fourteen, he formed Midnight Special, another modified skiffle band and played at a school concert. Then, when he heard Jimmy Giuffre playing saxophone on "The Train and The River", he talked his father into buying him a saxophone, and took lessons in tenor sax and music reading. Now playing the saxophone, Morrison joined with various local bands, including one called Deanie Sands and the Javelins, with whom he played guitar and shared singing. The line-up of the band was lead vocalist Deanie Sands, <a href=#>Guitarist</a> George Jones, and <a href=#>Drummer</a> and vocalist Roy Kane. Later the four main <a href=#>Musicians</a> of the Javelins, with the addition of Wesley Black as <a href=#>Pianist</a>, became known as the Monarchs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmemlrluuc6rqaKrn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdeneCkG5p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-brady-gisele-bundchens-family-album-pics-with-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchens Family Album: Pics With Kids</span></a>
