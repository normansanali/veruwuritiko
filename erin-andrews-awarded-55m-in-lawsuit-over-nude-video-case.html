The trial focused on the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt and video.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>On Friday, circuit court judge Hamilton Gayden found Barrett at fault. It was only up to jurors to decide if the hotel owner, West End Hotel Partners, and former operator, Windsor Capital Group, should share in the blame. The hotel is a franchise and Marriott is not part of the trial.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Attorneys for the companies argued that while what happened to Andrews was distressing, the convicted stalker should be solely to blame because he was a determined criminal.<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> The attorneys also suggested</a> that Andrews’ rise in her career shows she did not suffer severe and permanent distress.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Andrews said Barrett’s arrest and imprisonment did not make the ordeal end. She broke down on the stand repeatedly, saying she continues to suffer because people are still watching the videos and taunting her about them.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“This happens every day of my life,” Andrews said tearfully. “Either I get a tweet or somebody makes a comment in the paper or somebody sends me a still video to my Twitter or someone screams it at me in the stands and I’m right back to this. I feel so embarrassed and I am so ashamed.”</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Barrett pleaded guilty to stalking Andrews, altering hotel room peepholes and taking nude videos of her. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Andrews has maintained that someone at the hotel gave out her room number to Barrett and honored his request to be placed near her. She said no one ever told her that he asked to be in an adjoining or connecting room. Had she known that, she said she would have called police.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Barrett was a Chicago-area insurance company executive who frequently traveled around the country when he took the video of Andrews at the Nashville hotel in September 2008. He shot nearly five minutes of video of her while she was nude inside her room.</p><figure id=b43c8665-aa81-4f4a-a723-b9cb64f78ead data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuVideoBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1alawo7></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><a href=#>Sports broadcaster Erin Andrews breaks down during nude video lawsuit</a>.</span> Guardian</figure><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Barrett didn’t show up for the trial. In his videotaped deposition, he said that he alone was to blame. He said he correctly guessed that she would be at the hotel — it was the closest one to the Vanderbilt football game Andrews was covering — by calling and pretending to be in a group with Andrews and asking for confirmation of the reservations. He said he used an in-house employee phone to learn her room number, and made a request to be in the room next to Andrews.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>During closing arguments, one of Andrews’ lawyers said Barrett tried to take all of the blame because he holds a grudge against her over his conviction and doesn’t want her to win any money.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Barrett said he posted the recordings online after celebrity gossip website TMZ refused to buy them. The only reason he picked Andrews, he said, was because she was popular and he saw that she was trending on Yahoo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKugpL%2B1e5FpaG9nnZa%2FcHyWaJyroZ5irq%2Bw0Z6urGWRrK6zsMSdZG5tnWK2r3nLmq6srZmperDCxKtkp62Umnq3tcOepmabkaiy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-rosie-odonnell-steal-jerry-seinfelds-stand-up-material-before-she-wasnt-cast-on-seinfeld.html><span>←</span><span>Did Rosie O'Donnell Steal Jerry Seinfeld's Stand-Up Material Long Before He Didn't Cast Her On Seinf</span></a>
