That match had a ton of interest, but fans never saw a repeat. They also never saw another Great Balls of Fire event come around.</p><p>“I think if you’re in this industry, Brock is the type of match you should be seeking out. When you get into this industry, you should be gunning to work with the top, top guys. Brock was the top, top guy. When I was given the opportunity, I did my best to make the most of it every time I was in the ring with him. It’s important. You’ve got to have kind of a goal post and a bar of excellence that you maintain.&nbsp; It’s easy when you’ve got guys like Brock, guys like Kurt Angle, guys like Roman. You push yourself because they push.”</p><p>“For me it’s a good symbiotic relationship, because they’re going to give as hard as they get and vice versa. Any time I get an opportunity to get in the ring with those type of performers, a Randy Orton, these are guys who are at the top of their game. They do their very best to push their opponents. And they’re not going to give you an inch, and you’ve got to push back and can’t give them an inch. When that happens, there’s a weird symbiosis because you start producing really great stuff, because t’s a struggle out there and and you’re getting after it.”</p><p>Brock Lesnar re-appeared on the WWE roster page, but there are no current creative plans to bring him back. We might see him make a return, because there are plenty of other big events in the pipeline, but SummerSlam doesn’t seem like a location that we are likely to see Brock Lesnar’s return at this rate.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on Brock Lesnar’s booking in WWE?
