The duo, who are both prominent members of the music industry, said their "I do's" back in 2002, after having known one another and dated for 7 years! The couple share 3 beautiful children together and were regarded as one of&nbsp;Hollywood's happy families, or so we thought. In 2015, Gwen and Gavin announced their divorce due to "irreconcilable differences", and has quite a messy divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the two did not have a prenup, this set<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Gwen Stefani</a> up for what would be a storm of a divorce. Since she made more money throughout their marriage, Gavin would then be entitled to 50% of Gwen's earnings and assets. Splitting up is never easy, but it appears as if Gavin attempted to make things as painless as possible, or did he?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Reason Gwen Stefani's Ex-Husband, Gavin Rossdale Doesn't Act Anymore</a></span></p><h2 id=no-prenup-no-problem>No Prenup, No Problem?</h2><p>Gwen Stefani has been in the business since her No Doubt does, much like her ex-hubby, Gavin Rossdale, the duo was considered to be one of the biggest couples in the music industry. After marrying in 2002, Gwen and Gavin expanded their family, bringing 3 children into the equation, Kingston, Apollo, and Zuma Rossdale. Despite seeming like a picture-perfect family, it seems as if things weren't going well between the two. It was during this time that Gwen had launched her solo career and would later find herself as a judge on NBC's, "The Voice".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">With an impressive net worth of $150 million</a>, Gwen Stefani managed to make quite the name for herself as a solo act during her marriage. As for Gavin, who also had a successful career in music, he has managed to amass a net worth of $45 million, a significantly lower amount than Gwen. So, when the duo announced that the would-be splitting up in 2015, fans were quick to wonder how that would play out, especially since the two did not have a prenup.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Facts About Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale's Relationship That Were Swept Under The Rug</a></span></p><p>California law states that 50% of all earnings and assets should be distributed during a divorce by the top-earning person. As for Gavin and Gwen, this means the Bush singer would be entitled to 50% of Gwen's bank account and assets, however, he opted for much, much less! According to People Magazine,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavin decided not to abide by the 50% law</a> and asked for much less. Gwen also ensured that her earnings from her lines L.A.M.B and Harajuku Lovers would remain untouched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to financial settlement, the duo was granted shared custody of their 3 sons and had to share the sale of their Beverly Hills home. Gwen was able to keep the couple's 2 other Los Angeles homes, while Gavin got their 4 homes in Europe. The two finalized their divorce in April 2016, which was quite the fast split considering some celeb divorced take years upon years to settle.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gwen Stefani Is Not A Natural Blonde.
