He was then defeated in straight sets by Djokovic at the Melbourne major in January.</p><p>The 25-year-old’s biggest title to date came at the 2019 ATP Finals in London, where he overcame Dominic Thiem in a final set tiebreak in the final. He is also a two-time ATP Masters 1000 champion, having triumphed at the Monte Carlo Masters in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>Speaking to the media ahead of his appearance at the ATP 250 event in Antwerp this week, Tsitsipas discussed the challenge of winning a major title.</p><p>“Win a Grand Slam? I was close to succeeding in this challenge, I had my chances. Perhaps what I lacked was energy. I use way too much on a court. If you look at other champions like Djokovic, Federer and even Nadal, they know better how to manage all the effort that a Grand Slam requires,” said the Greek.</p><p>“The only time in my career when I was smart enough to handle all of this well was at the 2019 Masters (ATP Finals) and I won it. It takes a long time to master this management. But I’m still on the right track. I haven’t given up yet.”</p><p>The 10-time ATP titlist also spoke about his difficult recent run of form, which has seen him lose six of his last 10 matches.</p><p>“These last three, four months, I haven’t managed to gain many points, I admit. I relied a little too much on what I had learned,” explained the Greek.</p><p>“I thought I could also succeed by putting discipline aside a little, and focusing a little more on my talent. But that’s not how it works. Deep down, I feel like I want to turn things around with a good end to the season. I’m very hungry as I start this last indoor tour. I have never trained so much in my entire career.”</p><p>Tsitsipas will face Botic van de Zandschulp in his opening match in Antwerp on Thursday.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=#>ATP Rankings: The top five players under 21, ft.
