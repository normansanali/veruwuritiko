She has worked with streetwear labels such as Pretty Little Things and GDCS, as well as sportswear behemoth Reebok. Teyana Taylor is on her road to success after finally putting her amazing fashion sense to use for her own enterprise. In an exclusive interview with Women’s Wear Daily about her recently announced fashion collection, she stated:</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to build a universe for Junie where there are no boundaries, fear isn’t real, and you can do anything you want.” This is one of several stages in an attempt to modify the narrative that women are taught as they grow up about what they can and cannot achieve. I want to rewrite that narrative, and I intend to do so – anything is possible.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Teyana-Taylor-2.jpg alt="Teyana Taylor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The model and dancer explained that her JuJuBeez fashion collection offers matching adult and children’s clothes in athletic and performance wear designs, as well as a few loungewear items.
