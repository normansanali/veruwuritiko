Graham and Bledel star as Lorelai and Rory, an inseparable mother-daughter duo living in a quirky Connecticut town who reconnect with Lorelai’s estranged parents, Emily (<a href=#><strong>Kelly Bishop</strong></a>) and Richard Gilmore (played by the late Edward Herrmann).</p><p>Gilmore Girls was Bledel’s first major television gig — and also <a href=#>helped launch the careers</a> of now-household names such as <a href=#><strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong></a>. While plenty of recognizable stars graced the screen during the show’s seven seasons, even the most devoted Gilmore Girls fans may have forgotten about a few notable guest appearances.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Chad Michael Murray</strong></a> — better known for playing Lucas Scott on <a href=#>One Tree Hill</a> — got his start on Gilmore Girls as Rory’s Chilton classmate Tristan Dugray.

Tristan is briefly mentioned in the 2016 Netflix revival, <a href=#>Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life</a>, but Murray himself wasn’t part of the project.</p><p>“I mean, it would’ve been nice [to have him in the revival], but he’s busy,” <a href=#><strong>Liza Weil</strong></a>, who played Rory’s rival-turned-roommate Paris Geller, told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2016 of the heartthrob’s absence from the limited series. “He’s doing a lot of things and he’s doing very well for himself, Chad Michael Murray, so I think in all, I think it plays.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While fans might find it impossible to <a href=#>picture anyone other than Graham</a> in the show’s starring role, her career could have taken a totally different turn.</p><p>“I was really attracted to the language [of the show]. I connected to it in the way that I connected to things I’d done in theater. It felt a little heightened. … I thought it was so unique,” the Parenthood alum said during a <a href=#>Variety Actors on Actors interview</a> in 2017, admitting that she was warned that the character would “age” her. “At the time, everybody [in] my peer group saw it as a ‘mom role,’ predominantly. … I just felt like [Lorelai] was mine.”</p><p>Scroll down to look back at some of the stars you might have forgotten were in Gilmore Girls!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bctq25zqucZp%2BZp7m0eZBuZKyskafAbsXOrmSfp6KcvLV51p6pnmWZo3q1tMRmqp6qmZrAcLjErKOinV2ksbC5jKOpZqmlmru1tc1mrpqko518</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-living-next-to-madonna-was-a-nightmare-for-her-neighbors.html><span>←</span><span>Why Living Next To Madonna Was A Nightmare For Her Neighbours</span></a>
