Other than that, I am perfect.</p><p>“That damn thing is sore as s***. I’m at the doctor right now. They are gonna start injecting me with stuff.”</p><p>The Nature Boy – who has a pacemaker and previously revealed he will stop taking his blood thinners on the day of the match – admitted the injury is something which “affects him daily” and he’s having to adjust in the ring, but having a tag team bout instead of a singles match will make things easier.</p><p>He added: “I would just deaden it if I have to. You know me. It affects me daily.</p><p>“It’s hard running the ropes with the center of your foot… the middle of your foot is so sensitive. I’ve been training hard, doing two-a-days…</p><p>“[I’m] happier it’s a tag. I can hide myself a little more [laughs].”</p><p>Meanwhile, Flair revealed his daughter Charlotte will be in attendance in Nashville, Tennessee to watch the show, which takes place one night after WWE hosts its annual ‘SummerSlam’ event in the same city.</p><p>She’ll be joined by some other top WWE names, including the likes of Rey Mysterio, Pat McAfee and Apollo Crews, and ‘All Summer Long’ hitmaker Kid Rock/</p><p>Flair said: “She’ll be there, but I don’t know if she’ll be on camera. She wouldn’t miss that. I don’t think she would miss it, even if Andrade wasn’t involved.</p><p>“She just might not be on camera. A lot of guys are coming. Mysterio, Apollo, McAfee, Kid Rock will be there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOq6CcZZahrqq%2BjKysn56Vp8BuucinpqtlmaO3tr7YZp%2BemZSeu6h5yKerqGWclsC1ecSvnKtlnZbBpLSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-harry-meghan-markle-reveal-their-10-bridesmaids-and-page-boys.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Harry, Meghan Markle Reveal Their 10 Bridesmaids and Page Boys</span></a>
