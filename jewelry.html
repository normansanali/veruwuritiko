Therefore, we created a comprehensive guide on how to find the top fringes.</span></p><h3><b>Which Items Can Be Decorated Using Fringe Laces?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fringe laces are trending in the current fashion world because you can use them to decorate many items. Here are some ideas:</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Stitch fringe or tassel lace at the lower border of your t-shirt, jacket, dress, or more to make them look cool.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>You can also attach frill lace on the sides of your skin-tight leggings to make them a funky dance outfit.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The exterior of your mask can also be layered with these ruffle laces to make them look cute and fashionable.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Some people also love to decorate their purses and belts by attaching tassel lace to them.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>You can decorate your bed sheets, scarfs, pillowcases, lampshades, rugs, and more with high-quality frill laces.</span></li></ul><h3><b>How to Pick High-Quality Fringes</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>In order to purchase quality fringes, you’ll need to check a few factors that play a major role in making the tassel lace elegant and long-lasting.</span></p><h4><b>Material</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most of the highly admired fringes today are made from 100% cotton or polyester. These materials make the tassels durable, soft, and fluffy. Besides, they will not break or give rise to lint threads after using the decorated item for some time. If you have highly allergic skin, we suggest selecting a fringe lace made from pure cotton, as it is skin-friendly and hypoallergenic, meaning it won’t react with sensitive skin.</span></p><h4><b>Properties</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many fringe laces come with certain helpful properties, which make them more user-friendly and durable. Some of them are wrinkle-resistant and do not develop curls or knots, so you don’t have to iron them before use. You can also find some fringe laces with color-fastness property, which means they do not easily fade color and stay intact for a long period. They will not become dull or lose their shine even after multiple washes. We recommend that if you want your fringe laces to stay stylish for a long period, consider buying the product that has the properties mentioned above.</span></p><h4><b>Quantity</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another crucial factor to check before buying any fringe is the quantity provided in the pack. The majority of products come with 5 to 10 yards of frill lace, which is enough for decorating multiple outfits and home items. However, some fringes come with 3 yards of lace which is ideal for smaller DIY projects. Also, if you are a beginner who is just learning DIY art, it is suggested to experiment with smaller rolls of tassel lace to learn the art and develop the skill set.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Width</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most of the fringe laces come with a width of 4 to 6 inches. They are ideal for decorating bedsheets, carpets, pillowcases, and more such large-sized items. Furthermore, you can find a few smaller-width laces of 25mm that enhance the elegance of purses, masks, lampshades, and more. You can also make cute bracelets, tassel earrings, and more jewelry out of these small-width frill laces. Make sure to check the width of the fringe ribbon and select the one that fits your needs.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Color</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since fringe laces are decorative products, they are available in a wide range of vibrant colors like yellow, blue, red, green, orange, pink, white, black, and more. Besides, some packs of tassel laces come with multi-color ribbons that help you decorate different items. You can also select the same color tassel lace as whatever you’re attaching it to to make a monochrome look or choose a contrasting color of fringe laces for eye-catchy decoration.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Washability</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Many poor-quality tassel laces ruin or shrink after a few washes. Make sure to check the tassel ribbon's washing suitability, especially when you are using it for decorating clothes, bedsheets, pillow covers, or any item that might be washed frequently. Most of the latest fringes can be washed by hand. They also dry quickly in the air under sunlight. Our general rule, though, is to use cold water and mild detergents to prevent the hardening of fringes after the wash.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Reviews</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before selecting a fringe, make sure to go through both positive and negative reviews of the product. These comments are given by genuine customers, so they can help you know the real quality of the product. Besides, you might be able to find some dos and don'ts to maintain the fringe laces for a long period of time.</span></p><h3><b>How to Maintain Fringes For a Long Period</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Make sure to purchase a fringe lace that has its tassels tied with a soft white thread, as it prevents the tassels from abrasion. Moreover, you can easily remove this white thread while stitching the fringe lace to any item.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Do not bleach or wash the fringe lace in strong detergent, as it can ruin the softness, color, and quality of the material.</span></li></ul><h3><b>How Much Does Top-Notch Fringe Usually Cost?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The final cost of the fringe is typically determined by its material, color quality, durability, and quantity. Therefore, if you want high-quality tassel laces, you’ll have to spend anywhere from $12 to $17. You can also find some multi-color fringe ribbons that might cost you more because of the color variety and quantity</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>Can I iron fringes attached to my top?<p>No, you should not iron them, as it can damage the material. You can use wrinkle-resistant tassel laces, instead, as they do not develop curls or knots with time.</p>Are fringe laces on trend?<p>Yes, fringe or tassel laces are highly trending in the current fashion world.
