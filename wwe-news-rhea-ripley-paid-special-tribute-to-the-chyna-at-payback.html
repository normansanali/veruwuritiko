However, before her match, she came out to help the Judgment Day members win their match against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. During the ringside attack, fans noticed that Rhea had a unique ring gear on, which was based on the ring gear of WWE Hall of Famer <strong>Chyna</strong>.</p><p>This was confirmed later when she walked out for her match against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raquel Rodriguez</a>. Rhea Ripley paid homage to Chyna, who was known to be one of the most impactful female superstars of her time. Rhea’s gear was studded with diamonds and sparkles, similar to how Chyna used to wear during the Attitude Era. She was most notable for her work as a member of DX.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Chyna is considered a trailblazer by many superstars from the past as well as the present. However, she would unfortunately part ways with WWE after the Attitude Era, never to return again. She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of Degeneration-X along with Triple H, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Michaels</a>, the New Age Outlaws, and X-Pac.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Therefore, Rhea Ripley’s homage to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chyna</a> was a moving show of respect. Ripley would go on to retain her title against Rodriguez, with a little help from Dirty Dom towards the end of the match. However, Rodriguez revealed after the match that she was not done with Ripley and would strike back for the title again.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH: Michael Cole’s hilarious reaction to Rhea Ripley spearing Kevin Owens at WWE Payback that you didn’t see on TV</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wwe-hall-of-famer-torrie-wilson-praises-rhea-ripley-following-payback>WWE Hall of Famer Torrie Wilson praises Rhea Ripley following Payback</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_1693766235094.jpg><p>Rhea Ripley and the Entity of Judgment had a great outing at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Payback</a>.

The performance is getting a lot of acclaim from fans online.
