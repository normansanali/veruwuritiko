And rather than go with her typically blown-out blonde strands, her hair is done in tightly coiled Bantu knots‚Äîa style typically worn by Black and African women to protect their hair from excessive damage. When worn by white women, however, the style tends to be called out as a major case of cultural appropriation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Adele's caption, she was wearing the Caribbean-inspired ensemble to pay homage to the annual Notting Hill Carnival that takes place in her hometown. During the event, Britain's West Indian population takes to the streets of Kensington, celebrating their heritage and island culture. Carnival is also a celebration held across multiple Caribbean islands including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a28612045/rihanna-crop-over-2019/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Barbados class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Barbados</a> and the Bahamas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Happy what would be Notting Hill Carnival my beloved London üá¨üáßüáØüá≤," wrote the singer on Instagram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Minutes thereafter, Twitter imploded with a mixed bag of emotions. Many felt Adele was dipping her toes into the culturally appropriated pool, √† la <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a15920989/kim-kardashian-bo-derek-braids-cornrows/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Kardashian West" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kim Kardashian West</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/celebrity-hair-makeup/news/a38273/miley-cyrus-vmas-dreadlocks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miley Cyrus" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Miley Cyrus</a>, who have both dealt with controversies over "trying on" very Black hairstyles. Others felt less enraged and just laughed at the perplexing image. An even smaller group felt that Adele was simply "honoring" an inspiring culture that plays a central role within her community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It appears that Adele didn't mean any harm with her Carnival outfit, but most celebrities who find themselves in hot water over "trying on Blackness" never seem to. Whether it's defined as appreciation or appropriation, one needs to remember that Black, West Indian, and African cultures aren't a trend‚Äîthey're a rich heritage. And they are much more than just "fun" hairstyles, outfits, or costumes that can be slipped on or off at a non-Black person's convenience.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
