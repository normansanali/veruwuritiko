<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Venus Williams Husband: Who Is Venus Williams Husband?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Venus Williams husband-American professional tennis player, <a href=#>Venus Ebony Starr Williams</a> was born on June 17, 1980.</strong></p><p>Williams was born to Lynwood, California in the United States of America to Oracene Price and Richard Williams. She shares the same parents with her five siblings; Serena Williams, Yetunde Price, Richard Williams III, Lyndrea Price and Isha Price.</p><p>When she was thirteen, the Williams family relocated from Compton, California to West Palm Beach, Florida so that she and her sister Serena could enroll in Rick Macci’s tennis program. Macci saw the sisters and offered them more coaching.</p><p>Even while he did not always agree with Williams’ father, he liked the fact that “he treated his daughters like kids and let them be little girls.”</p><p>When Williams was eleven, Richard stopped sending his girls to national junior tennis competitions because he wanted them to take it gently and concentrate on their academics.</p><p>He apparently overheard the parents of other players disparaging the Williams sisters during competitions, which led to another motive being racist.</p><p>Williams was the top-ranked under-12 player in Southern California at the time and had a 63-0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour.</p><p>Richard withdrew his girls from Macci’s academy in 1995 and took over all coaching at their house going forward.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Venus Williams career</h2><p>Williams is a seasoned tennis player from the United States. Williams, a former No. 1 in both singles and doubles, has won seven Grand Slam singles championships, including two at the US Open and five at Wimbledon.</p><p>She is largely recognized as one of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. Venus Williams’ parents, Oracene Price and Richard Williams, also taught her younger sister, Serena.</p><p>She became a professional in 1994, and at the 1997 US Open, she made it to her first major final. Williams won the Wimbledon and US Open championships in 2000 and 2001, and she also won the Olympic singles gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20150026/image-500.png><p>She first attained the singles world No. 1 rating on February 25, 2002, becoming the second woman overall and the first African American woman to do so during the Open era (after Althea Gibson).</p><p>Between 2002 and 2003, she made it to four straight major finals but fell to Serena each time. After that, she experienced injuries and only achieved one major victory between 2003 and 2006.</p><p>Beginning in 2007, when she won Wimbledon (a feat she repeated the following year), Williams found her form again. She regained the No. 2 singles ranking in the world in 2010, but injuries struck once more.</p><p>She steadily regained form beginning in 2014, which culminated in two major final appearances at the 2017 Australian Open and Wimbledon.</p><p>Together with Serena, Williams has won 14 women’s doubles major championships, giving her a total of seven major singles victories. The two have an undefeated record in Grand Slam doubles finals.</p><p>On June 7, 2010, she and Serena won the non-calendar year Grand Slam at the French Open, and she rose to the top of the doubles rankings for the first time.</p><p>In addition to Venus’ gold in singles in 2000 and her silver in mixed doubles in 2016, the couple also captured three Olympic gold medals in women’s doubles in 2000, 2008, and 2012. Williams also took home two major mixed doubles championships, both in 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20182241/image-508-1024x512.png><p>On the women’s professional tennis tour, the Williams sisters are credited with bringing about a new era of strength and athleticism.</p><p>Williams is the active player with the second-most singles titles, behind only her sister Serena, with 49 WTA Tour victories.</p><p>Her combined total of 73 WTA trophies, which includes 22 WTA doubles titles and two mixed doubles wins, places her second among active players behind Serena.</p><p>Along with Serena, she is one of just two players still competing who have advanced to all four major singles finals.</p><p>Williams twice led the league in season payouts (in 2001 and 2017), and as of March 2022, she was second only to Serena in total career payouts with almost US$42 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Venus Williams’ relationship status?</h2><p>From 2007 to 2010, Williams was in a relationship with Hank Kuehne who was a prominent figure from the time of Wimbledon in 2007 until 2010.</p><p>She met Cuban model Elio Pis in 2012 after hiring him as an underwear model for her clothing company; their relationship lasted until 2015. Prior to 2019, she dated publishing mogul Nicholas Hammond for two years.</p><p>As of 2023, she is believed to be single.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq%2Bcp62jYsSquMuimKarXZ3CtK7Ap5to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tedarrell-slaton-jr-umile-iphone-case.html><span>←</span><span>Tedarrell Slaton Jr. UMILE iPhone Case</span></a>
