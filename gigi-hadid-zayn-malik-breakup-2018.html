I'm forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared.

They have crazy work schedules that would put pressure on any relationship.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The same source alleges that the breakup was amicable and "they both have respect for each other." Although neither of the two have addressed the rumors, it should be noted that Zayn does not currently follow Gigi on Instagram—but she still follows him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fans were also quick to notice that Zayn unfollowed Gigi's sister Bella on Instagram a few weeks ago too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple's last Instagram together was posted by Gigi for Zayn's birthday on January 12. The model posted a sweet selfie video along with a series of photos captioned, "love this man more than I could ever put into words, & am inspired by his drive to be and do better everyday ✨ cheers to YOUR YEAR my @zayn - happiest happiest birthday & 25th year of life !! I’m proud to be by your side x."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This wouldn't be the first time Gigi and Zayn has decided to call it quits.
