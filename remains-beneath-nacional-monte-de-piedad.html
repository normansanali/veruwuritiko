Axayáctl’s son was Moctezuma II, one of the empire’s last rulers who was killed in 1520.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287529 alt="Nacional Monte De Piedad Building" width=900 height=580 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nacional-monte-de-piedad-building.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-287529 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Nacional Monte de Piedad was built in the 1770s and has since become a charity, pawn shop, and loan provider.</span></p><p>Though archaeologists had previously identified parts of the palace over the last two decades, the recent discovery of the building’s foundation was a milestone.</p><p>“Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayáctl, probably a courtyard,” the INAH statement continued. “While in that palace, numerous events took place,” including perhaps the death of Moctezuma himself.</p><p>The basalt slabs were first found in September 2017 as officials were making preliminary efforts to refurbish the Nacional Monte de Piedad. The entire following year was essentially spent on unearthing the rest of the foundation to assess and authenticate these remnants.</p><p>In addition to the palace, experts found the remains of a house built by Cortés after the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. The Spanish ruthlessly ordered the Aztecs to destroy their temples and palaces upon taking control, while using the same materials to build entirely new structures — like this house.</p>Footage of the dig site within the Nacional Monte de Piedad, showing part of the former palace’s hidden courtyard.<p>“These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations,” INAH explained.</p><p>The institute added that the conquistador and his troops inhabited the new home for numerous years. It even became the first seat of their new government in 1525.</p><p>Now, nearly 500 years later, that same site serves as a national charity, pawn shop, and loan provider.</p><p>Excavations in Mexico continue to astound experts in the region.
