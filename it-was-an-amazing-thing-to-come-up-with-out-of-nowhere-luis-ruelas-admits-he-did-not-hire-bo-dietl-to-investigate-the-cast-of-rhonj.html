No one watches <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Housewives of New Jersey</a></strong> (RHONJ) for the socioeconomic and anthropological insights. It’s all about the drama! Fortunately, there was buckets of that on hand during Watch What Happens Live (WWHL), as <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luis Ruelas</a></strong> took back a claim that he hired a private investigator to spy on the cast.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>During the explosive finale of the show, Ruelas made the claim he hired famous P.I. Bo Dietl, who had “sh*t on about everybody in the room” and “brought me information on each person” in the group, and that it wasn’t just “gossip.”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>On WWHL, Ruela’s wife, cast member Teresa Giudice, said the P.I. statement was something he “just said” and that the idea came “out of nowhere.” Ruelas, who was sitting in the audience of the show, agreed.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Ruelas said he was “at the end” of his rope and that the long season wore him out, on top of “you know, trying to get married.” Andy Cohen seemed incredulous, remarking that the statement was an “amazing thing to come up with out of nowhere.”</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>The famous husband agreed, and said he regretted saying it. Giudice said “he did not do it” and pledged to defend her husband, claiming he wouldn’t “waste his money” and he only said it because he was “frustrated” by “what they were putting him through.”</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>“Do you know how much that would cost? How many people are on the cast to investigate each person?” Giudice said. “Do you think we’d want to waste our money on that? No. I’d rather him waste his money on me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#RHONJ</a> OG Teresa Giudice and husband Louie Ruelas speak out on his private investigator claim. <a href=#>@Teresa_Giudice</a> <a href=#>#WWHL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UjJIs1WCQV</a></p>— WWHL (@BravoWWHL) <a href=#>May 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>People aren’t really buying the story, however, with many fans calling them disparaging names. “So, Luis is a liar. Thank you for confirming,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one person</a> said on Twitter.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>“‘Hired’ being the operative word. Luis said Bo was one of his best friends so either tea for free or Luis totally lied about everything,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">someone else</a> said. “They are toxic people steer clear,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> replied. Other important drama involved the couple being shunned by Melissa and Joe Gorga, who reportedly did not attend the wedding.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The drama around that could fill a dictionary-sized novel, but basically the show is on hold until Melissa Gorga and Giudice bury the knives. The show was supposed to start filming in June, but a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that “No official decisions on Season 14 have been made as the finale, Teresa and Louie’s wedding special and the reunion episodes have yet to air.”</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=false>Say what you will, they know how to stir the tea. The idea that the show “won’t” be coming back will probably only stir up even more interest in it. Funny how that works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tXnWmqpmmZ5irq6t2aKloGWknbavs4ytpmabn6KybsHPZq6irJhivLbAjKidZqafrLWmvsRmo66ho2K%2FtrHLmqpmmZSitrW%2FjKGcZpyZmXqvu9Nmn6KqlWKvsHnDopytpF2pvG61za%2BcrKyZnK61sYytn55lk5bAtXnOn2SroJ%2Bjt3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-gilbert-on-johnny-galecki-kaley-cuoco-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>How Sara Gilbert Felt About Ex-Johnny Galecki's Relationship With Kaley Cuoco</span></a>
