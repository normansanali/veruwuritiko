Once you've selected the car you want, you choose your payment method and then upload any documents necessary. The car is then delivered, and then you have seven days to decide if you want to keep it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>Though Carvana markets itself as being a <a href=#>less stressful way to buy a car</a>, red flags are being raised. In 2018, a man from Denver told local news that Carvana sold him a car that was damaged and stolen. Dennis Atencio told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 7 Denver</a>, "At first, I thought it was the most enjoyable car buying experience that I've had."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Seven months after buying the car, Atencio woke up to find his car had been repossessed. According to police, it was reported stolen from Memphis, Tenn., just a few months before Atencio bought it. Consumer protection attorney Matt Osborne said the car was originally a <a href=#>Hertz rental</a> from Memphis International Airport. It had several titles open on it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Atencio also discovered the car had been damaged. Its SOS inspection revealed there was wrinkled metal, a faulty radiator, and several missing bolts. SOS Inspections owner Norris Schleeter said he was shocked to see the amount of damage, adding, "You can't run it through an inspection and not notice these problems."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So Carvana was out here scamming ppl and selling stolen cars????</p>— fled Jamaica for a whopper (@foreverimbetter) <a href=#>July 2, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Carvana is also selling cars without titles</h2><p>In a viral Twitter thread, people commented about their negative experiences with Carvana.

If you discover you bought a stolen car from Carvana, get in contact with police immediately. Carvana should also be notified and all pertinent documents should be gathered.</p><p>Depending on the situation, it may be a good idea to lawyer up. If pulled over driving a Carvana car (or any car) without a title or matching VINs, or one that's been stolen, it definitely won't be just a slap on the wrist. You may need to go to court to get your money back if the car gets impounded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKGjYrCivtWapZplo5q5rbXNoGSsrJ%2Bhsq95wpqprGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-jones-net-worth-how-much-is-tom-jones-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Jones Net Worth: How Much Is Tom Jones Worth?</span></a>
