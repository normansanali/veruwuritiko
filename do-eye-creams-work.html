It boils down to your personal skincare concerns, according to consultant dermatologist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Dr Shaaira Nasir</a>.</p><p id=eEaBDByEt6gv data-wc=59>The skin around the eye is extremely delicate, much thinner than that of the rest of your face. It also "lacks oil glands", meaning it is more prone to both dryness and irritation. When weighing up whether an eye cream is right for you, Dr Nasir advises that you think about what it is that you're trying to target.</p><p id=eYWpQTtMKfXq data-wc=17><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What is double cleansing and how to do it right - according to a celebrity facialist</a></p><p id=e1SdWS6lc7 data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>What is slugging and is it actually good for your skin?</a></strong></p><p id=ezxAYo8SCy69 data-wc=36>"If it's just hydration, you could just use your normal face moisturiser as eye cream," she says. "Whereas if it's puffiness, look for eye creams containing caffeine, and for anti-ageing concerns look for retinol or peptides."&nbsp;</p><p id=eBMwQ1a-gvEz data-wc=27>"For anti-pigmentation, look for arbutin [a brightening ingredient], liquorice, vitamin C, or kojic acid, and for increased hydration, you want one containing hyaluronic acid, ceramides or niacinamide."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Can an eye cream reduce the appearance of dark circles?&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ep1oW-KapvpV data-wc=33>Yes, it can – but the key here lies in the word 'reduce'. A topical eye cream can help improve the appearance of <a class=hm-link href=#>dark circles</a>, but there are likely other factors at play.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHIrZieOeEE data-wc=48>"Dark circles can be caused by many things such as hay fever or eczema, hyperpigmentation, underlying veins, or structural hollowness causing shadowing," Dr Nasir says. It cannot alter the physical structure of the skin, and so, managing your expectations is crucial, so that you are not left disappointed.</p><h2><strong>How to apply eye cream</strong></h2><p id=ePsUDX3f84tG data-wc=41>Eye creams can be slotted into your skincare routine either in the morning and at night. Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to UV rays, and so if your eye cream contains this ingredient, it is better kept for night usage.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWMlZao8Yq data-wc=47>Brightening eye creams containing antioxidants such as vitamin C are great for the morning. "Once a day is enough but it can be applied twice a day," Dr Nasir says. "If the eye cream is thick, it may be better used at night to avoid looking greasy."&nbsp;</p><p id=eW0_QKPyzj2x data-wc=27>After cleansing, apply a pea-sized amount of product onto your finger and dab it gently around the eye area, starting in the inner corner and working outwards.</p><h2>How we chose:</h2><p id=eoH6NzkK9n data-wc=24><strong>Dermatologist-approved:&nbsp;</strong>The eye cream product inclusions have been selected by Dr Nasir, all of which she loves and, where relevant, recommends to her clients.</p><h2><strong>Best anti-ageing retinol</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/38aa996641de-redermic-r-retinol-eye-cream-la-roche-posay.jpg><p id=eXJBdxm3OTf data-wc=49>La Roche-Posay's Redermic [R] Retinol Eye Cream is formulated to reduce the signs of ageing around the eye such as wrinkles and fine lines. It is the French pharmacy brand's first retinol-enriched product for sensitive eyes and contains 0.1% pure retinol and 0.1% of its exclusive Retinol booster complex.</p><h2><strong>Best anti-ageing retinaldehyde</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1927f9db7914-crystal-retinal-ceramide-eye-cream-medik8.jpg><p id=ed7d6V6onY data-wc=41>Inspired by the brand's original Crystal Retinal serum, this product contains retinaldehyde and is actually available in three different strengths depending on your skin concerns. Is aims to combat the appearance of crow's feet and also features ceramides for extra nourishment.</p><h2><strong>Best anti-ageing peptide</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ae10cc32105c-youthful-eye-serum-no7.jpg><p id=etPAQM3sZL data-wc=39>No7's Youthful Eye Serum contains a blend of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C to hydrate and brighten the skin around the eye. It also is packed with anti-ageing peptides to improve firmness and reduce the appearance of fine lines. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Best for hydration</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/62d55cf21a55-skinceuticals-eye-cream.jpg><p id=eM8OQQlvzF data-wc=40>SkinCeuticals' Eye Balm is best suited to dry (those lacking oil) and mature skin types. The product is a rich blend of vitamin E, great for protecting the skin's moisture barrier, and the anti-inflammatory ingredient aloe vera to reduce puffiness.</p><h2><strong>Best for puffiness</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d4eb64081c26-caffeine-eye-cream-the-inkey-list.jpg><p id=eVSxeqkCro data-wc=40>This eye cream by The Inkey List's hero ingredient is the natural antioxidant caffeine. This works to relieve water retention, thereby reducing puffiness – ideal if you tend to wake up in the morning with a slightly swollen eye area.</p><h2>Why you should trust Dr Nasir:</h2><p id=e0ag5f4Hft data-wc=50>With a wealth of industry experience under her belt, Dr Shaaira Nasir is one of London's leading consultant dermatologists. She currently practises at the BMI London Independent Hospital, Skin55 Harley Street and Sk:n.
