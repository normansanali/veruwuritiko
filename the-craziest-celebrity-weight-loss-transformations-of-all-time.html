Adele’s celebrity friends <a href=#>went crazy for her new look</a>, which she reportedly maintains with <a href=#>the Sirtfood diet</a> and help from a personal trainer.

The “Modern Family” star later revealed that her dramatic weight loss occurred <a href=#>after she switched antidepressants.</a> “For years I had been on antidepressants that caused me to gain weight that I couldn’t lose no matter what I did,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “It was always frustrating for me because I wanted to be able to get fit and feel like the work I was doing was paying off, but it never felt that way. I had accepted it and moved on.” Since coming clean, the 22-year-old actress has continued to show off her waist <a href=#>in sexy Instagram posts</a>.
