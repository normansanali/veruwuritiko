The rapper sizzled and showed no signs of distress following Rob Kardashians latest allegations against her.</p><p class=fh>Blac Chyna made a rare appearance at the Grammy Awards and <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/26/blac-chyna-grammys-2020-dress-photos/>stood out in red on the red carpet</a>.

She stood out on the red carpet due to the shimmering fabric of her dress.</p><p class=fh>Chyna made sure fans noticed her intricate tattoos on her thigh and lower leg by posing with her red heels forward and her slits wide open. She also drew attention to her face emphasized by bronzed eyes and pink lips.</p><p class=fh>The rapper’s hair fell in gentle waves way past her shoulders and smiled for photographers who delighted in her rare appearance. On her Instagram, she shared a slow-mo clip of her sultry look as she posed for photos. She <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B7z6lLbFj4c/>described</a> it as "Beauty at its finest" in her caption. Never mind that she matched the red carpet because she managed to stand out.</p><p class=fh>In another post, she posed outdoors and wrote, "I’m living my life to the fullest, focus on the positive." We're guessing this is her mantra nowadays considering her recent problems with her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian and their battle over their daughter, Dream Kardashian.</p><p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>A NASTY BATTLE</strong></h3></p><p class=fh>Earlier this month, Kardashian filed new court documents demanding an amendment in their existing joint custody agreement. The reality star accused Chyna of drug and alcohol abuse and an unfit mother for their daughter. He cited Chyna’s lack of attention to Dream’s hygiene and alleged she taught their daughter to twerk naked and act out sexual positions.</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Chyna</a>’s camp reportedly denied the accusations and is determined to battle it out in court with Kardashian who’s demanding to reduce Chyna’s time with their daughter to the weekends with a nanny present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8b2ca0bd09d10748601324ea5b0de96542340581578545922.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna at the latter's birthday celebration at the Hard Rock Cafe in May 2016. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM</strong></h3></p><p class=fh>The war between the exes simmered early last year when they seemed to come to a good place in their co-parenting arrangement. Chyna even <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://twitter.com/BLACCHYNA/status/1100449265124405248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1100449265124405248&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Ftv%2Frob-kardashian-blac-chyna-coparenting-daughter-dream%2F">lauded</a> Kardashian for being a “wonderful father.” He, on the other hand, confirmed that they were active co-parents who had no pending cases in court at the time.</p><p class=fh>But the tides have turned and the two are seeing another round of hearings with Kardashian’s latest move. We don't expect Chyna to back down and suspect a long battle to ensue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwanBpZ3qjuMCcZJygqaOubrLLmqynrKNiuaaz0maqoaGdorKzxYyrnJ1ll6TEb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-billie-eilish-single-ex-boyfriend-q-brandon-adams.html><span>←</span><span>Billie Eilish's Sweet Revenge To Ex-Boyfriend Brandon Adams Got Her A Grammy Award</span></a>
