An 81-year-old man struck two patrol cars and Popp, who was outside of his vehicle. He was taken to Hurley Medical Center in Flint, where he passed away.</p><p>Local news site M Live reported on Tuesday that the 81-year-old has been released from the hospital. An investigation into the crash is underway.</p><p>Michigan state police said Popp enlisted with the force in January 2020, graduating as a member of the 137th Trooper Recruit School. A report by Midland Daily News states that more than $58,000 has been raised for his family since his death. He is survived by his wife Stefanie and a young daughter.</p><p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags in the State Capitol Complex and upon all public buildings in the state of Michigan to be lowered on January 31, 2024, in recognition of Popp's life and service.</p><p>"Trooper Joel Popp was a proud husband, dad, and public servant who loved Michigan," Whitmer said.</p><p>"We mourn his loss and remember the values he embodied that define the best of the Michigan State Police. After joining the agency later in life, he served his community with distinction.</p><p>"Our hearts are with his wife, Stefanie, their young daughter, and all those who knew and served with him."</p><p>Dan DeWolf, 52, a member of the Fairville Volunteer Fire Department, died after suffering a cardiac arrest while at the scene of a house fire on January 21. He served the northern part of the town of Arcadia for 32 years and is survived by his granddaughter, son, mother and siblings.</p><p>Speaking to New York news service WHEC, DeWolf's ex-mother-in-law Jessie Collins said: "He was one of the most wonderful, greatest men that walked on earth."</p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul directed flags on all state buildings to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Wednesday in his honor.</p><p>"Our volunteer firefighters put their lives on the line day in and day out to keep their communities safe, selflessly putting the safety of others first," Hochul said.</p><p>"The loss of Dan DeWolf will be felt across New York as it highlights the risks these firefighters take on voluntarily. My heart is with Mr. DeWolf's loved ones and his fellow firefighters. We are thankful for his service."</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jp%2Bjmp%2BjYrWiuMVmpJqrpGLBsLDAsmSwnZSjsrSwwLJkpqGTnbaorc1mpZ6vXa68s7eMam9vbWdrfQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./isabel-haugseng-johansen.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Erling Haalands Girlfriend, Isabel Haugseng Johansen &amp;amp; What Does She Do?</span></a>
