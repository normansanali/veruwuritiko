As Bachelor Nation continues to ship <a href=#><strong>Hannah Brown</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a>, the former Bachelor joked that he hopes the pair procreate while quarantining together during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“They’re probably just friends, but also it’s crazy times,” Viall, 39, said on <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lauren Zima</strong></a>’s “Fireside Chats” Instagram Live series on Thursday, March 19. “Sometimes in crazy times people do crazy things. They could just get pregnant, you never know! We need an out-of-a-relationship Bachelor baby. That’s the next drama that needs to happen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nick-Viall-Jokes-He-Wants-Hannah-Brown-and-Tyler-Cameron-to-Have-an-Out-of-a-Relationship-Bachelor-Baby-02.jpg><p>The Entertainment Tonight host, 33, agreed, saying, “I think we need, like, an out-of-relationship knock-up. Like, someone gets knocked up.”</p><p>The Bachelor franchise host, 48, was not on the same page, however. “I don’t know if that’s what we need,” he reasoned.</p><p>With that said, Viall took a moment to clarify, explaining, “When I say ‘need’ I just mean it would be fun for everyone — except maybe the people involved.”</p><p>Brown, 25, and Cameron, 27, sparked dating rumors earlier this month after they were <a href=#>spotted together in his hometown of Jupiter, Florida</a>. As the coronavirus outbreak continued to worsen in the U.S., the Bachelorette alums began <a href=#>spending more time together</a> with their group of friends, whom they <a href=#>dubbed the “quarantine crew.”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nick-Viall-Jokes-He-Wants-Hannah-Brown-and-Tyler-Cameron-to-Have-an-Out-of-a-Relationship-Bachelor-Baby.jpg><p>Amid the speculation, Harrison insisted that he has no idea whether the former pageant queen and the model are romantically involved again.</p><p>“I hope they’re safe. I love them both and I wish them all well,” he said on Thursday’s livestream. “And by the way, for those asking, I don’t know. I don’t know.”</p><p>Brown and Cameron have been keeping busy as of late by <a href=#>making TikTok videos</a> and <a href=#>doing outdoor workouts</a> with their squad. Just one day before joking about the duo having a baby, Viall made headlines for <a href=#>throwing shade at them</a>, saying on Instagram Live, “Stay the f–k home. Stop doing TikTok videos with groups of people in a pool.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While all eyes are on the reality stars’ relationship, a source close to Cameron told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this week that they are <a href=#>simply “great friends</a> [who] have a lot of fun together.” A second insider revealed, “Tyler and Hannah are <a href=#>very much aware of the attention</a> that’s been on them recently. They think it’s funny that people are so invested.”</p><p>Cameron <a href=#>finished as the runner-up</a> on Brown’s season of The Bachelorette in 2019. She <a href=#>called off her engagement</a> to <a href=#><strong>Jed Wyatt</strong></a> shortly after the finale, and the general contractor had a <a href=#>two-month fling</a> with model&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> that summer. Cameron and the Alabama native reconnected after his mother <a href=#>Andrea Cameron’s death</a> on March 4.</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
