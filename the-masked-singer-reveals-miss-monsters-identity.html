During the Wednesday, February 12, episode, the Fox show <a href=#>revealed quite the surprise</a>: A tour! That’s right, all of fans’ favorite characters will come to life onstage in a 45+ stop tour that will include a spectacular live show and celebrity guests.</p><p>So, will one of the season 3 singers be included? It’s definitely possible. <a href=#><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a> joined this week’s episode of the hit series to narrow Group A down from four singers to three. Did you guess correctly?</p><p>The Turtle performed first and in his video, he stood on a football field and revealed that his biology teacher had a message. During the video, a map pointed to Seoul, Korea. He also read a valentine for host <a href=#><strong>Nicole Scherzinger</strong></a>: “I’ll never forget the morning we spent together.”</p><p>It’s safe to assume this is <a href=#><strong>Jesse McCartney</strong></a>; he was once on the Today show the same day the Pussycat Dolls performed. His hit song is also “Beautiful Soul.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Masked-Singer-turtle.jpg><p>Next, Miss Monster’s video showed a teddy bear, white socks, a piece of pizza and camo clothing. Plus, her hairstylist revealed that she hasn’t always been in the limelight for the right reasons. Her valentine was for <a href=#><strong>Robin Thicke</strong></a> and it read, “I only have EYE for you. We even had a rendezvous in Sin City.”</p><p>Kangaroo’s younger brother by one year <a href=#>gave her clues this week</a> and he revealed that as a teen, his sister was a drama queen but still resilient. She also held the family together after they went through a tragedy. The video featured a model airplane and an angel statue. Her valentine was to guest judge Leah Remini. “We’ve sat at the same table and your courage has inspired me,” she said.</p><p><a href=#>Many believe this</a> is <strong>Jordyn Woods</strong> — she does have an older brother, who’s a model that she’s very close to.</p><p>Lastly, the White Tiger’s college roommate revealed his clues. The video showed a quarter on the bar, open butter wrappers, a “Route 66” sign and a phone off the hook. His Valentine to <a href=#><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong></a> was, “I’m wild about you but I know your husband will appreciate this card even more.”</p><p>Most believe this is <a href=#><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong></a> — and <a href=#>those hints seemed to confirm it</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Unfortunately, Miss Monster was eliminated and revealed to be Chaka Khan!</p><p>The Masked Singer airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2irrS3xJ1krKGenLKzedGerZ6ZnKh6rrXSrGSmp56owaa%2B0magnZ2eqba1xY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Finty Williams Son Sam Williams?
