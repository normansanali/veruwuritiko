To be a mom, you don’t know how hard it is until you become one. Mothers you are truly goddesses and single moms you are my superheroes. The past six weeks have been such a blessing. Jupiter, you are everything and more.”</p><p><a href=#>Tisdale announced her pregnancy news</a> in September 2020, six years after <a href=#>marrying French</a>. The couple<a href=#> revealed the sex of their upcoming arrival</a> by cutting into a pink cake in October 2020.</p><p>The <a href=#>Masked Dancer </a>judge felt “lucky” that her husband was “on the same page” about waiting to start a family, she exclusively told Us Weekly in March 2021. “We were clear like, ‘OK, I think it’s time and we’re ready.’ I definitely have that motherly side, especially with how I treat my dogs. We’re definitely ready to be parents.”</p><p>The “It’s Alright, It’s OK” singer<a href=#> reflected on her “physically exhausting” pregnancy</a> as she neared the end, explaining to Us, “I popped very early on where some of my friends didn’t pop until really later in their pregnancy. So I think they probably have much more time to enjoy it. It’s definitely been a little hard at times and it’s heavy. … Right now [with] the pandemic, I don’t feel comfortable going to chiropractors or an acupuncturist where they would normally help you through this moment. But we’re getting through it. We’re almost there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tisdale added at the time that she doesn’t plan to show her daughter her Disney Channel projects, explaining, “I don’t watch that stuff myself and my husband really hasn’t seen that stuff either. If she’s watching with her friends one day, I might come across it. But I don’t think I would expose her to that stuff. I don’t know. Maybe when the time comes, it will be different. I want her to be really grounded and hopefully live somewhat of a normal life.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Tisdale’s first child’s sweetest shots, from adorable outfit glimpses to father-daughter photos.Tisdale and French got dressed up as safari experts who were on the hunt for their “unicorn” Jupiter on Halloween in October 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkrrS0y56wZqyZqLGiuMRmmqGqmajBsLzHnqlmnqKau6S00mabmq2XncGmvoyjrKmhpJq%2FtHnBmpmyZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./power-rangers-jason-david-frank-dead-dies-tommy-oliver-green-white.html><span>←</span><span> 'Power Rangers' Star Jason David Frank Dead By Suicide at 49</span></a>
