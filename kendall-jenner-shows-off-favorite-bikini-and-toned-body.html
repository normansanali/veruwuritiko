Look out Kim, Kendall Jenner is making waves with her off the charts bikini body.
In a series of pictures she posted to Instagram on Tuesday, March 3, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star showed off her svelte, incredibly toned bod in a two-piece swimsuit that she seems to be obsessed with — and we don’t blame her.
“Me and this bikini: a love story,” she wrote as the caption to the snaps from her vacation in the Bahamas."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Look out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kim</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> is making waves with her off the charts bikini body.</p><p>In a series of pictures she posted to Instagram on Tuesday, March 3, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star showed off her svelte, incredibly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">toned bod</a> in a two-piece swimsuit that she seems to be obsessed with — and we don’t blame her.</p><p>“Me and this bikini: a love story,” she wrote as the caption to the snaps from her vacation in the Bahamas. The itsty bitsy number is a multi-colored print string bikini from one of her favorite brands: Sommer Swim.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Xena Baroque</a> set features a halter top that can be worn in multiple different ways. There’s the style that Jenner rocks, which is a strapless version with the extra strings tied in the center, falling down her torso. Or there’s a crisscrossed version that other Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">models </a>seem to favor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though we can’t see the back of the bottoms, it’s like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thong option</a>, seeing as the brunette stunner has favored this style in the past. Back in December 2019, the 24-year-old took a break and was spotted lounging around on a yacht with friends in Miami wearing a seriously cheeky orange swimsuit from the same brand.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tuesday’s patterned item itself has sold out in the specific style Jenner favors. But there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of other options</a> in the same print, from bandeau and high-waisted pairings to bralette tops to bottoms with ties on the sides. No matter what you choose, all variations cost the same: $69.</p><p>But for now, we’ll just have to admire the super sexy string style on the model. So keep scrolling to see Jenner rock this bikini like no one else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKnqWdmZyhequxzaecq2Wjnby4v4yonZ9llpbDsL7IrZxmmpmgtq%2B1jJqlnWWkpLumsIybpp2xXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kesha-on-her-haters-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ke$ha on Cannibal and Her Haters</span></a>
