Though he did not divulge more information about the marriage and its subsequent divorce, he says that he was pretty young and was not ready for each other, but they still maintained a friendship with the said lady.</p><p>It appears that Jonathan has moved on because he currently got a new girlfriend. The new girlfriend in question is Jacinta Kuznetsov, who works with them in their company.&nbsp; Jacinta, 29 weeks as a development producer, met in 2015 at a charitable organization, and the couple currently lives in Toronto.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Property-brothers-not-gay.jpg alt="Property brothers are not gay" width=600 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source:- Facebook</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is-Drew-Scott-gay-Married-to-a-wife-or-got-a-girlfriend></span>Is Drew Scott gay?
