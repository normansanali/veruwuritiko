"It was the Hôtel Costes," he told The Daily Mail (per People). "She was wearing a dress with an exposed back and I saw that back and that neck, and then she turned around and I saw those eyes, and — boom! My life as a single man was done."</p><p>The White Wedding actress later said that they had an "instant" connection. "We were in two different worlds — him in America, me in France — but we had friends in common," she shared to Elle UK. "We saw each other sometimes over the course of four years. But then, the day we found each other in Paris, we were both in the same world and free and it was just instant. There was no more time to waste — just no way around it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They then welcomed their first child, Lily-Rose, in 1999. Jack was born three years after. In 2004, the couple purchased a $3.6 million island in the Bahamas for their family. But four years later, Paradis clarified that marriage wasn't part of their future plans. "Each summer people say we're supposed to be getting married, but we don't talk about it that much," she said at that time.</p><p>"He's got me, and he knows he's got me," she continued. "I love the romance of 'let's get married,' but then, when you have it so perfect … I mean, I'm more married than anybody can be — we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it's something I can really do without."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Isla Fisher Refused To Shoot An Intimate Scene With Johnny Depp In An Animated Film For One Particular Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-johnny-depp-and-vanessa-paradis-break-up>Why Did Johnny Depp And Vanessa Paradis Break Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar41725196.jpg><p>In January 2012, sources revealed that the couple had been living separately. That same month, the Heartbreaker star attended a film premiere without Depp, fueling rumors of their breakup. The <a href=#>Edward Scissorhands alum</a> denied the speculations in May but later confirmed it the following month alongside Paradis.</p><p>Depp's publicist told Entertainment Tonight back then that they had "amicably separated." They added that the two "tried for months to save the relationship, but have known for weeks that it couldn't be saved." Apparently, their separation "was all decided before she got on that plane" for that premiere which the <a href=#>actor-turned-painter</a> had skipped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For over a year, the pair refused to discuss their relationship with the press. But they maintained a good co-parenting relationship behind the scenes. In 2016, Paradis expressed support for Depp amid domestic abuse allegations against him. In a handwritten letter, she said: "In all these years I have known Johnny he has never been physically abusive with me and this looks nothing like the man I lived with for 14 wonderful years."</p><p>She continued to show public support for the Jeanne du Barry star during his defamation trial against Heard. Paradis filed a declaration in Depp's defense, saying: "I have seen that these outrageous statements have been really distressing, and also caused damage to his career because unfortunately people have gone on believing these false facts."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's Divorce Is Said To Be The Next Johnny Depp And Amber Heard Drama</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-johnny-depp-cheat-on-vanessa-paradis-with-amber-heard>Did Johnny Depp Cheat On Vanessa Paradis With Amber Heard?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar47695175.jpg><p>It's unclear whether Depp's relationships with Paradis and Heard really overlapped. But according to court documents, the actor started dating his now ex-wife "around the end of 2011 or the start of 2012." Based on other reports it seems that Depp and the mother of his children were already having issues by the time he started shooting The Rum Diary with Heard in Puerto Rico, back in 2009.</p><p>Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2013, Depp admitted that his work and schedule had put a strain on his relationship with Paradis. "Relationships are very difficult," he explained. "Especially in the racket that I'm in because you're constantly away or they’re away and so it's hard. It wasn’t easy on her. It wasn't easy on me. It wasn't easy on the kids. So, yeah."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that "The trajectory of that relationship — you play it out until it goes, one thing leads to another. So for whatever reason that ­ceases, it doesn't stop the fact that you care for that person, and they're the mother of your kids, and you'll always know each other, and you're always gonna be in each other's lives because of those kids. You might as well make the best of it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7ypus2yZJ2doKV6pLTEmqtmp55iw6K6xKyqmmWglr%2BisMisZLChpJ16ornBnqlmoJWWv6V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dateline-who-is-sheree-mclaughlin-loud-maurizio-gucci-girlfriend-speaks-out-on-what-exactly-happened.html><span>←</span><span>Dateline: Who Is Sheree Mclaughlin Loud?
