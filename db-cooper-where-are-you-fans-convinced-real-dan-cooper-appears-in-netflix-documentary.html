Taking to social media, some even have a theory that the real Mr. Cooper appears the in documentary himself.</p><p id=eAmOFxZ_dbYt data-wc=56>One person couldn't help but point out a likeness of one FBI investigator in the documentary with the sketch created at the time of his disappearance.

Cooper was never solved</strong></p><p id=eEzByKbDDvh1 data-wc=41>By 1976, the FBI had interviewed over 800 suspects as well as witnesses who claim that have met the real Dan Cooper. Eventually, after many more men become lead suspects but after finding nothing, the case was then dropped in 2016.</p><p id=eN3h58I5Mobe data-wc=42>Due to the crime taking place in 1970, the case has always been an enormously difficult one to crack. Police techniques, such as DNA, were not around in that time and a body was never found – meaning the mystery lives on.</p><p id=esVTrR0SvcD7 data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
